<div>At Lakeside Primary, we strongly believe that “Every Individual <b><u>CAN</u></b>!” – can <b><u>C</u></b>ontribute, can <b><u>A</u></b>chieve, and can be <b><u>N</u></b>urtured. Thus every child who enters the gates of Lakeside Primary is engaged in a plethora of specially designed programmes and activities in a vibrant learning environment, to provide him/her with opportunities to be curious, to explore and develop holistically.
</div>
<br>
<div>Our students’ learning experiences matter to us. Unique learning experiences and opportunities are designed for our students to nurture them into <b><i>Lifelong Learners and Virtuous Leaders</i></b>, with an emphasis on the development of 21st century competencies; through our school-wide <b><i>Learn to Think, Think to Learn</i></b> Programme and our signature Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in the Performing Arts, in order to prepare them to be future-ready. Anchored in our LakesidePRIDE values; Love, Perseverance, Responsibility, Integrity, Diligence, rEspect, we are committed to the character development of our students through our character and citizenship programme complemented by our Primary 1 – 6 Values-In-Action programme.</div>
<br>
<div>To fulfil our hopes and vision for our students at Lakeside Primary, the commitment of our highly dedicated staff and teachers, together with our parents’ positive engagement and synergistic partnership with our School Advisory Committee (SAC) and the community, is truly valued and appreciated.</div>
