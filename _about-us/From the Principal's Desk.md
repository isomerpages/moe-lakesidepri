<div>At Lakeside Primary, we strongly believe that “Every Individual <b><u>CAN</u></b>!” – can <b><u>C</u></b>ontribute, can <b><u>A</u></b>chieve, and can be <b><u>N</u></b>urtured. Thus every child who enters the gates of Lakeside Primary is engaged in a plethora of specially designed programmes and activities in a vibrant learning environment, to provide him/her with opportunities to be curious, to explore and develop holistically.

<div>Our students’ learning experiences matter to us. Unique learning experiences and opportunities are designed for our students to nurture them into <b><i>Lifelong Learners and Virtuous Leaders</i></b>, with an emphasis on the development of 21st century competencies; through our school-wide <b><i>Learn to Think, Think to Learn</i></b> Programme and our signature Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in the Performing Arts, in order to prepare them to be future-ready. Anchored in our LakesidePRIDE values; Love, Perseverance, Responsibility, Integrity, Diligence, rEspect, we are committed to the character development of our students through our character and citizenship programme complemented by our Primary 1 – 6 Values-In-Action programme.
