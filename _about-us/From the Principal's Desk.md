Dear Lakeside Parents and Guardians,<br><br>
Welcome to a new academic year at Lakeside! I am really honoured and feel very privileged to serve as the Principal of Lakeside Primary School from 2024.<br><br>
As we embark on this journey together, I am thrilled to share our overarching theme for the year: <b>"Take Charge, Make a Positive Difference."</b> This theme, an extension from last year’s, embodies our continued commitment to nurturing young minds not only as lifelong learners but as proactive, empathetic individuals poised to make a positive impact in the world.<br><br>
Our mission at Lakeside remains centred on <b>providing quality education to nurture wholesome individuals</b>. We are dedicated to cultivating a caring and enabling environment where every student feels empowered to become <b>lifelong learners and virtuous leaders</b>.<br><br>
At the heart of our approach are the <b>Lakeside PRIDE</b> values—<b>Love, Perseverance, Responsibility, Integrity, Diligence, and rEspect</b>. These values serve as guiding principles, anchoring our students as they strive to achieve their fullest potential.<br><br>
I personally believe that a robust education system must develop the creativity of the child. It is through the exploration and generation of new ideas that children broaden their horizons and cultivate the confidence and conviction to serve a purpose larger than themselves. Beyond acquiring knowledge and skills, our students need to be adaptive in their thinking, be able to appreciate and connect across cultures and embrace diverse viewpoints. <br><br>
With our theme of <b>“Take Charge, Make a Positive Difference”</b>, we will continue with our efforts to enhance the learning spaces within our school environment while contributing positively to sustainability and environmental conservation. To create a resilient future, we endeavour to cultivate a community where every student embraces the ethos of being creators, connectors, and contributors by regularly reflecting on how they can embody our school's values as lifelong learners and virtuous leaders in their daily lives.<br><br>
We strongly believe that parents and guardians are the foremost and most influential teachers in their child's life. Your active involvement in your child's education is invaluable and we welcome all parents to actively participate in our school life, <b>taking charge and making a positive difference</b> alongside us at Lakeside Primary.<br><br> 
With our dedicated staff, excellent resources, and engaged students, I am confident that, with the ongoing support of all stakeholders, we will take our school to greater heights of excellence.
Let us unite in our endeavour to make Lakeside Primary a beacon of positive change within our community and beyond. Together we can <b>CONTRIBUTE. ACHIEVE. AND BE NURTURED!</b>
