Dear Lakeside Parents and Guardians,<br><br>
I hope you are as excited as I am about the new school year at Lakeside Primary! 
Having experienced the full suite of Lakeside school experiences as a new member of the school in 2024, I really feel very privileged to serve as the Principal of Lakeside Primary School to empower every student in Lakeside to make a positive difference in the community.
<br><br><br>
<b>Our Vision, Mission, and Core Values</b>
<br><br>
Last year, I led the staff and students to -REIMAGINE Lakeside. We have refreshed our school vision to nurture our students into <b>‘Creative Thinkers, Empathetic Leaders, Lifelong Learners’</b> so that they are empowered to make a positive difference to their community. Our school values have also been refreshed to include <b>Excellence</b> as an inspiration for our students to seek continuous improvements and strive to achieve their personal best.
<br><br>
At the heart of our efforts is the creation of a caring and enabling environment where every student is equipped to make a difference - whether in their class, school, family, neighbourhood, or Singapore as a whole. Our <b>LPRIDE</b> values - <b>Love, Perseverance, Respect, Integrity, Diligence, and Excellence</b> - anchor our approach, guiding our students as they grow and flourish. Every Laker will be able to acquire 21st century dispositions through our Lakeside curriculum and start strong at their choice secondary school at the end of the 6-year educational experience at our school.
<br><br>
<b>Fostering Creativity and Adaptability</b>
<br><br>
I personally believe that a robust education system must develop the creativity of the child. It is through the exploration and generation of new ideas that children broaden their horizons and cultivate the confidence and conviction to serve a purpose larger than themselves. Beyond acquiring knowledge and skills, our students need to be adaptive in their thinking, be able to appreciate and connect across cultures and embrace diverse viewpoints.
<br><br>
<b>2025: Lead with LPRIDE</b>
<br><br>
With our 2025 theme of <i>“Lead with LPRIDE”</i>, we will continue with our efforts to reinforce our school values in how we live our lives, lead ourselves and lead others. As we look forward to celebrating Singapore’s 60th birthday, we are inspired by our President, Mr. Tharman’s call to <i>“be that special someone”</i> who adds meaning to others’ lives. Together, we will cultivate a community of creators, connectors, and contributors who add purpose to each other’s lives and contribute to a stronger Singapore.
<br><br>
I am confident that every staff and student at Lakeside will Take Charge and make a Positive difference daily. We endeavour to cultivate a community where every student embraces the ethos of being creators, connectors, and contributors by regularly reflecting on how they can embody our school’s values as creative thinkers, empathetic leaders and lifelong learners in their daily lives.
<br><br>
<b>Partnering with You for Success</b>
<br><br>
We seek your strong partnership with us, parents/guardians and various stakeholders to be that influential teacher in our students’ lives too. Your active involvement in your child’s education is invaluable and we welcome all parents to actively participate in our school life, <b>to lead with LPRIDE, taking charge and making a positive difference</b> alongside us at Lakeside Primary. Your partnership is paramount and would multiply our efforts. Together, I am confident that every Lakeside student will gain the strong foundation that will propel him/her to greater achievements in life.
<br><br>
With our dedicated staff, excellent resources, and the ongoing support of all stakeholders, we will take our school to greater heights. Let us unite in making our school a beacon of positive change within our community and beyond. Together, we can <b>CONTRIBUTE, ACHIEVE,</b> and be <b>NURTURED!</b>
<br><br>
<b><i>Lead with LPRIDE, Take Charge and make a Positive Difference!</i></b>
