<div style="font-size:14pt;" align="justify">Dear Lakeside Parents and Guardians,<br><br>
Welcome to a new academic year at Lakeside Primary School. It is my pleasure to partner you in nurturing every child to become a <b>Creative Thinker, Empathetic Leader, and Lifelong Learner</b>, guided by our LPRIDE values — <b>Love, Perseverance, Respect, Integrity, Diligence, and Excellence</b>.<br><br>
This year, we are excited to launch our <b>B’Right Culture</b> — a whole-school culture of Care, Leadership, and Thinking. Building on the success of our B’Right Room and student wellbeing programmes since 2019, we are extending the same spirit of care and empowerment to every classroom, where <b>every Laker feels a strong sense of belonging and is supported to grow and contribute</b>.<br><br>
We are proud that our B’Right Culture was featured at the <b>Teachers’ Conference and ExCEL Fest 2025</b>, and that our Head of Department for Pupil Development was conferred the <b>2024 MOE Outstanding Innovator Award</b>. This recognition affirms the dedication of our staff and the positive impact we see in our students daily.
Guided by our school theme, <b>“Lead with LPRIDE”</b>, we place strong emphasis on developing empathetic communication — the ability for children to understand perspectives, express themselves respectfully, manage emotions, and work well with others. Through the teaching of <b>Executive Functioning Skills</b> and <b>Leader in Me</b> habits, students learn how to listen actively, pause and think before responding, articulate their feelings, and resolve conflicts constructively. These are essential life skills that strengthen relationships and build confident, caring leaders.<br><br>
<b>How Parents Can Support at Home</b><br><br>
You play an important role in reinforcing these skills beyond school. Simple actions make a big difference:<br>
<ul><li>Model empathetic listening by acknowledging your child’s feelings before offering solutions</li>
<li>Encourage your child to use respectful language when sharing thoughts or disagreements</li>
<li>Ask reflective questions such as “What were you thinking?” or “How do you think others felt?”</li>
<li>Celebrate effort, self-control, and positive choices — not just outcomes</li></ul>
It is my first belief that when home and school work together, children develop a strong, consistent foundation for character and communication.<br><br>
With our dedicated staff and strong partnerships with families, we remain committed to creating a caring and enabling environment where every child knows they matter, where growth is celebrated, and where students are empowered to make a positive difference.<br><br>
We look forward to a meaningful year of learning, growth, and shared successes.
<br>

With warm regards,
<br>
