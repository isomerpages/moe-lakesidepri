We are one big happy family<br>
Different races coming together <br>
Learning and playing in harmony

We love, we share, we persevere <br>
Together withstanding all tests<br>

Pledging to do our best

Let us spread our wings <br>
Soaring towards excellence <br>
Upholding our values<br>
To serve our school with pride and joy

We love, we share, we persevere <br>
Together withstanding all tests<br>
