<div style="text-align: center;">In Lakeside Primary<br>
We are one big happy family<br>
Different races coming together <br>
Learning and playing in harmony
<br><br>
We love, we share, we persevere <br>
Together withstanding all tests<br>
Lakeside Primary, let's strive for success <br>
Pledging to do our best
<br><br>
Let us spread our wings <br>
Soaring towards excellence <br>
Upholding our values<br>
To serve our school with pride and joy
<br><br>
We love, we share, we persevere <br>
Together withstanding all tests<br>
Lakeside Primary, let's strive for success <br>
Pledging to do our best<br>
Pledging ourselves to be the best
