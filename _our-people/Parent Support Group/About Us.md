<h5>Parent Support Group</h5>
The Lakeside Primary School Parent Support Group (PSG) is a volunteer organization made up of parents who aim to enhance our children’s well-being and learning through collaborative alignment with the school’s objectives, thereby complementing and strengthening its programme. The PSG is managed by an Executive Committee (EXCO).
<h5>VISION</h5>
A community of dedicated and committed parents coming together to work in partnership with the school to nurture the holistic development of our children.
<h5>MISSION</h5>
PSG plays a key role in inspiring and guiding parents who wish to contribute to the school’s efforts, coordinating their time and effort effectively to give our children the best education experience.
<h5>FOR PARENTS, BY PARENTS</h5>
We foster an inclusive environment where parents can connect, share experiences, and support one another through the challenges of parenting and education. 
By collaborating on initiatives, sharing valuable resources, and advocating for our children’s needs, we create a powerful network that enhances the school community. 
Joining the parent support group is not just about volunteering; it's about making a meaningful difference for our children and shaping a brighter future together.
<br><br>
“Being part of the parent support group is not just about volunteering it’s a powerful message that you are your child’s biggest supporter and that their journey matters!”
