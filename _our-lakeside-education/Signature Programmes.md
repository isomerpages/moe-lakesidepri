<b>Programme Objectives:</b>
<br>
The Learn to Think, Think to Learn programme aims to develop students into life-long learners by increasing student engagement and deepening understanding of subject content through equipping them with critical and inventive thinking skills.
<br><br>
<b>Overview:</b>
<br>
Thinking is central to learning. When we think, we observe, build explanations, reason with evidence, make connections, consider different viewpoints, get to the heart of issues, uncover complexity and ask questions. When students are able to do these thinking moves routinely and skilfully, they can then engage more deeply with subject matter and achieve deeper understanding.
<br><br>
Towards that end, teachers make use of various thinking routines to promote and surface students’ thinking. Through listening, questioning and documenting students’ learning, their thinking is made visible to allow for examining and improving.
<br><br>
Bit by bit, lesson after lesson, we help our students learn to think, so that they can think to learn.
