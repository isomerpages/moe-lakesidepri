<b>Programme Objectives:</b>
<br><br>
<b>Lakeside Applied Learning Programme (ALP)</b>, Thinkers with Heart 2.0”, seeks to nurture students who are equipped with knowledge, skills and 21st Century Competencies to contribute actively to the school and community. Aligned with our vision of developing creative and caring learners, this programme allows students to apply their classroom learning to authentic, real-world issues while fostering empathy and responsibility as concerned citizens.

Our ALP is anchored in sustainability education, focusing on key national challenges such as waste management, food security, water security and climate action. These are aligned to Singapore’s Green Plan targets and framed through Design Thinking (DT) and Applied Learning principles. Students engage in authentic experiences that nurture Joy of Learning while building critical and inventive thinking, communication, and collaboration skills.
