<b>Programme Objectives:</b>
<br><br>
<b>Lakeside Applied Learning Programme (ALP)</b>, Thinkers with Heart 2.0”, seeks to nurture students who are equipped with knowledge, skills and 21st Century Competencies to contribute actively to the school and community. Aligned with our vision of developing creative and caring learners, this programme allows students to apply their classroom learning to authentic, real-world issues while fostering empathy and responsibility as concerned citizens.

Our ALP is anchored in sustainability education, focusing on key national challenges such as waste management, food security, water security and climate action. These are aligned to Singapore’s Green Plan targets and framed through Design Thinking (DT) and Applied Learning principles. Students engage in authentic experiences that nurture Joy of Learning while building critical and inventive thinking, communication, and collaboration skills.

<b>ALP Framework</b>
<br>

The Thinkers with Heart framework is designed using the principles of Applied Learning:

<b>Design Thinking Protocol</b>
<br>

Design Thinking undergirds the ALP, enabling students to empathise, define, ideate, prototype and test solutions for authentic problems. These experiences allow students to take ownership of their learning while building adaptability and resilience.

Our Primary Three students apply design thinking to tackle waste management issues through an authentic and multi-disciplinary learning experience. As part of the Little Thinkers Camp, the students go on learning journeys to a variety of locations and gain real-world insights before creating prototypes and presentations to advocate for responsible waste management habits in Lakeside. The programme, integrated with Social Studies, English, and ICT tools like Google Slides and Padlet, also develops students’ 21st Century Competencies such as adaptability, communication, and collaboration.

<b>P4 ALP</b>

Our Primary Four students explore the theme of food security through a series of meaningful experiences. From planting onions as part of Science lessons to orienteering during a Physical Education lesson to find suitable spaces around school, learning is hands-on and engaging. As part of the Little Explorers Camp, students visit a farm and learn how the farm supports Singapore’s food sustainability. Back in school, students utilise the Design Thinking phases to ideate, prototype their eco-plot designs using LEGO and present their ideas with the use of GoogleSlides. Through this, our students develop key 21st Century Competencies of adaptive thinking, collaboration and communication.
