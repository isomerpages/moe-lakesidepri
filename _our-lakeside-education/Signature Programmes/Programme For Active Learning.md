<br><br>
<b>Overview:</b>
<br>
The Programme for Active Learning (PAL) is a recommendation by the 2009 Primary Education Review Implementation (PERI) Committee to provide greater emphasis on non-academic programmes for all Primary 1 and 2 students. To encourage learning beyond the classroom, Lakeside Primary School offers PAL, which gives the students opportunity to discover their interest, learn new skills and develop their characters.
<br><br>
PAL@Lakeside, is one of the platforms where students develop confidence, curiosity and cooperation skills. Students are exposed to varied and fun learning experiences in four domains; Sports and Games, Outdoor Education, Performing Arts and Visual Arts during PAL lessons within the curriculum. The learning experiences incorporates values and social-emotional learning where the students reflect and share their learning with their peers.
