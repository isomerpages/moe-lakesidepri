<b>Programme Objectives</b><br><br>
Executive Functioning (EF) skills are a set of skills which guides our thoughts and behaviour to achieve goals. These skills underlie the capacity to plan ahead to meet goals, display self-control, follow multiple-step directions, even when interrupted. These are the skills needed to get things done successfully in our day-to-day or long term tasks. <br>
These skills are important to our students as they constantly need to remember instructions, complete a task without being distracted and adapt to changes. Research has shown that when children have opportunities to develop EF skills, they experience lifelong benefits as these skills are crucial for learning and development towards adulthood. EF skills also encourage positive behaviour and allow students to make healthy choices for themselves. <br>

<b>Overview</b><br><br>
At Lakeside Primary School, EF skills are introduced and practised at every level to equip students with these skills that are crucial for learning and development. At least 2 skills are taught at each level at the beginning of each semester. These skills are inculcated during lessons, CCAs and other teachable moments in their primary school journey. 
The table below shows the EF skills that we introduce to our students and an example of the accompanying guiding questions students can use. More information can be found on Pg 16 and 17 of our Student Handbook.
<br><br>
We have also come up with some mascots to help our students better remember the various EF skills!
