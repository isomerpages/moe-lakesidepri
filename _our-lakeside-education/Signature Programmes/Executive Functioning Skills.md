<h4>Understanding Executive Functioning Skills</h4>
<b>What Are Executive Functioning Skills?</b><br>
<div style="font-size:14pt;" align="justify">Executive Functioning Skills (EFS) are the mental processes that enable us to plan, focus attention, remember instructions, juggle multiple tasks, and regulate our emotions. Think of these skills as the “air traffic control system” of the brain — helping to manage and direct our thoughts, actions, and emotions so that we can achieve our goals.<br><br>
<b>Why Are These Skills Important?</b><br><br>
Executive functioning skills are crucial for:
<ul><li>Academic success and learning efficiency</li>
<li>Social relationships and emotional well-being</li>
<li>Future career readiness and life skills</li>
<li>Self-regulation and independent living</li>
<li>Problem-solving and decision-making abilities</li></ul>

<b>Developing Executive Functioning Skills in Lakeside</b><br><br>
At Lakeside Primary School, we believe that students thrive when they are equipped with the skills to <b>manage themselves, work well with others, and take ownership of their learning.</b> Our approach to executive functioning skills supports this belief by strengthening the habits and mindsets that help children grow into empathetic leaders and lifelong learners. These skills are not taught in isolation. Instead, they are woven into everyday learning experiences to support our school vision.<br><br>
Through EFS, students learn to:
<ul><li>Manage emotions and behaviour thoughtfully</li>
<li>Make responsible choices and adapt to change</li>
<li>Stay focused, plan ahead and persevere with challenges</li>
<li>Reflect on their learning and strive to improve</li></ul>
These skills help children develop empathy, resilience and independence — qualities that are essential for both leadership and lifelong learning.
To provide clarity and consistency for students, staff and families, LSPS aligns Executive Functioning Skills with Leaders in Me. This ensures that children encounter the same messages, language and expectations across classrooms, programmes and school experiences.<br><br>
Our integrated approach brings together:
<ul><li>Executive Functioning Skills (EFS) – helping students manage attention, emotions and actions</li>
<li>Leaders in Me (7 Habits) – nurturing leadership, responsibility and positive relationships</li>
<li>Lifelong Learning Dispositions – encouraging reflection, perseverance and resourcefulness</li></ul>

By aligning these frameworks, we help students see clear connections between:
<ul><li>How they manage themselves</li>
<li>How they learn and reflect</li>
<li>How they interact with others and contribute positively to the community</li></ul>
To help students better understand and remember the different Executive Functioning Skills, we have introduced a set of learning mascots.<br><br>
Watch the video below to get to know our mascots.

<b>How Can Parents Partner with the School to Develop Executive Functioning Skills at Home?</b>

<ol><li>Read through the list of observable behaviours in the coloured boxes.</li>

					<li>Note which behaviours your child consistently displays and which ones they might struggle with</li></ul>
<li>Affirm your child if they can display the skill</li><br>
<li>Use the EFS mascots to highlight positive behaviours.</li>
For example: “You are always able to stay focused on completing your homework. Well done, On-Task Tiger!” <br><br>
<li>Identify two or three skills to focus on and strengthen over time. Sit down with your child and discuss which skills they would like to focus on</li>
			<ul><li>Create structured routines</li>
