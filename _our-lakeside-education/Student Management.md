<h5>LAKESIDE PRIMARY SCHOOL APPROACH TOWARDS DISCIPLINE</h5>
<br><br>
<img src="/images/Department/09PD/PUPIL_M1.png" style="width: 80%; height: 80%;">
At Lakeside Primary School, our discipline framework focuses on cultivating self-leadership, accountability, and respect in all students. Rooted in Restorative Practices (RP), our approach emphasizes empathy, relationship-building, and sustainable behavioral change over punitive measures. By addressing inappropriate behavior promptly and constructively, we ensure students develop the self-discipline and character necessary for lifelong success.
<br><br>
<b>Key Components of Our Discipline Framework:</b><br><br>
<b>1.	Setting Clear Expectations</b><br>
We establish a safe, respectful, and conducive learning environment by clearly communicating behavioral expectations. This proactive approach fosters consistency and reinforces positive behavior across the school community.<br><br>
<b>2.	Stop, Think, Do – Traffic Light Method</b><br>
Using the “Stop, Think, Do” method, students are guided to pause, reflect on their actions, and make responsible decisions. This process aligns with our school’s LPRIDE values, encouraging self-regulation and thoughtful decision-making.<br><br>

<b>3.	Restorative Practices</b><br>
Restorative Practices form the heart of our discipline approach, focusing on accountability, repairing harm, and strengthening relationships. Through restorative circles, students explore the impact of their actions on others and work towards meaningful resolutions.<br><br>
<b>1.	Prevention</b><br>
We promote a positive school climate through proactive initiatives such as:<br>
• PAVE (Pre-Assembly Values Education) and Recess Engagement<br>
• Social Skills Workshops and Cyber-Wellness Activities<br>
• ACES (After Curriculum Engagement and Support) Programme<br>
• Peer Support and Leadership Development Programmes<br><br>
These initiatives reinforce core values, enhance well-being, and reduce the likelihood of negative behaviors.<br><br>
<b>2.	Intervention</b><br>
When misconduct occurs, we apply restorative interventions to ensure fairness and dignity. Key strategies include:<br>
• Facilitating circle time to address issues constructively<br>
• Encouraging students to acknowledge mistakes, take responsibility, and repair harm<br>
• Supporting reintegration through relationship healing and community support<br><br>
<b>3.	Restoration</b><br>
Even when consequences are necessary, they are implemented with a restorative focus. Examples include:<br>
• <b>Behaviour Contracts</b> and <b>Reflection Time (RT)</b> to encourage personal growth<br>
• Traditional consequences such as detention, suspension are used in conjunction with restorative efforts<br><br>
<b>Conclusion</b><br>
Lakeside Primary School’s discipline approach ensures that every student is supported in developing empathy, accountability, and resilience. By combining clear expectations, thoughtful interventions, and restorative practices, we nurture responsible, self-disciplined individuals ready to lead with integrity.<br><br>
