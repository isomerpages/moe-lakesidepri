<b>Goals:</b>
<br><br>
We aim to develop programmes, practices and processes to enhance the school experience of every Laker. Through a progressive approach, we hope to cultivate character, deepen values and SEL competencies in our students. We will also work towards fostering of partnerships with stakeholders to provide quality-learning experiences for our students.

<b>Overview:</b>
<br><br>
The Student Development Team (SDT) oversees the character development and holistic learning experiences of the students.
<br><br>
The SDT comprises three Year Heads (YHs) and three Assistant Year Heads (AYHs). Each Year Head is in charge of two blocks and each Assistant Year Head is in charge of one block. In building a culture of care, SDT partners the Pupil Development and Character & Citizenship Education departments. Collaboratively, the team employs a structured referral system to support the varied learning and behavioural needs of the students.
<br><br>
In enhancing a rich learning environment, SDT looks into providing a myriad of programmes across the levels. Throughout the six years of education with the school, the students undergo programmes of the different domains leveraging on their strengths, discovering their potential and overcoming the challenges. All these experiences contribute towards quality student experiences and outcomes.

<b>Key Programmes:</b>
<br><br>
<u>Orientation Package ‘Start Right Right from the Start’</u><br>
‘Start Right Right from the Start’ (SRRS) provides opportunities for students to learn and adjust back to school life. Besides setting class rules and expectations, SRRS takes on a differentiated level-focused approach with active participation through fun and meaningful activities. The students will learn new skills and know more about their peers to foster positive relationships through participation. Most importantly, we aim to help all students to start off right for the year.
<br><br>
<u>Learning Journeys and Outdoor Lessons</u><br>
To enhance the students’ learning experience and to instil joy of learning, the school partners external organisations and agencies to organise outdoor lessons and learning journeys. The lower primary students enjoyed trips to watch a play or musical in a theatre and the outdoors like the National Orchid Garden. The middle primary students went on a learning journey to Singapore Science Centre, Geylang Serai and National Gallery Singapore while the upper primary students got to experience cultural exposure to places such as Indian Heritage Gallery and Asian Civilisation Museum, The Primary 5 students also experienced camping as part of their holistic learning experiences. 
<br><br>
<u>Parents Engagement</u><br>
Parents are our valuable partners in education. The school holds the Meet-The-Parents (MTP) and Parents’ Connection Session (PCS) in the beginning of the year and Parent-Child-Teacher-Conferencing (PCTC) in May to engage our parents in the holistic development of their child’s educational journey.
<br><br>
Meeting the parents at the beginning of the year serves as a platform that allows the teachers to communicate their expectations to the parents. It also enables the parents to meet their child’s teachers and establishes a communication channel between both parents and teachers. The school leaders share with the parents the school vision, mission and values, key MOE initiatives and important information pertaining to the respective levels.
