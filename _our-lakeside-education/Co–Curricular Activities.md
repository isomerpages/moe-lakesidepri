<b>Curricular Goals:</b><br>
We aim to develop every student to be an active artist and informed audience, who appreciates and communicates confidently through Arts. Our students will be able to enjoy, explore and experience Arts through active engagement in our art and music programmes. Through these programmes, there will be opportunities for students to express passion, creativity, respect and excellence through Art.
<br><br>
<b>Overview:</b>
<br>
Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) is an integral part of the total curriculum.
<br><br>
In our CCA delivery, we not only provide opportunities for students to acquire specific skill sets, but more importantly, we place great emphasis on imparting our school values as well as developing the social-emotional competencies.
<br><br>
All Primary 3 to Primary 6 students are strongly encouraged to join a CCA so as to develop the whole child holistically. Once they are allocated a CCA, they are expected to fulfil their CCA commitment through Primary 6, so as to develop their fullest potential in harnessing the 21st century competencies.
<br><br>
The five categories of CCAs are as follows;

For Aesthetics and Clubs, we provide various platforms for the students to showcase their talents. Some examples are performances during festivities, community events and Singapore Youth Festival.
<br><br>
For Sports CCAs, we provide opportunities for students to play in game settings such as inter-school carnivals, zonal and national sport games. Through these platforms, we seek to develop well rounded students who are passionate lifelong learners with values of respect, teamwork and perseverance.
