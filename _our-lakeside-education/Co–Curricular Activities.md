<b>Curricular Goals:</b><br>
We aim to develop character, values and competencies that will prepare our students for a rapidly changing world. Through their active involvement in Co-Curricular activities, students discover their interest and talents. <br><br>
Through their interaction with one another, friendships will be forged among students from diverse backgrounds as they learn and grow together. With this learning experience in an authentic landscape of CCA in action, our students learn to collaborate and deepen their sense of belonging, commitment and sense of responsibility towards the school and spirit of service to the community.

<b>Overview:</b>
<br>
Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) is an integral part of the total curriculum. In our CCA delivery, we not only provide opportunities for students opportunities to acquire knowledge and specific skill sets related to the CCA. More importantly, we place great emphasis on imparting our school values as well as developing the social-emotional competencies.<br><br>
All Primary 3 to Primary 6 students are strongly encouraged to join a CCA to develop the whole child holistically. Once allocated a CCA, they are expected to fulfil their CCA commitment through Primary 6, to develop their fullest potential in developing their potential and harnessing the 21st century competencies. The three categories of CCAs are as follows:

Each CCA has its specific learning objectives. For Performing and Visual Arts, we provide various platforms for the students to communicate, collaborate and work together to share their love for the arts. Some examples are performances during in school celebrations, community events and Singapore Youth Festival.
<br><br>
For Sports CCAs, we provide opportunities for students to play in game settings such as inter-school carnivals, zonal and national sport games. Through these platforms, we seek to develop well rounded students who are passionate lifelong learners with values of respect, teamwork and perseverance.
<br><br>
In Clubs, students learning are organized by broad themes of learning focus, while UG provide students with authentic learning experiences which will help them develop important qualities such as leadership, teamwork and resilience.
