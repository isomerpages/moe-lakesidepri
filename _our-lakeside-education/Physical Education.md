<br>
We aim to develop in our students an understanding and the application of a range of movement skills, which will enable them to participate in a variety of physical activities. While they enjoy and value the benefits of living a physically active and healthy life, they will also display positive personal and social behaviour through the demonstration of safe practices during physical activities.

<b>Overview:</b>
<br><br>
<img src="/images/Department/06PE/PE1.png" style="width: 60%;">
In Lakeside Primary, we want to equip every student with the physical skills, practices and values to enjoy a lifetime of active, healthy living. We make use of movement as the primary medium to teach the whole child through;<br>
<ul><li>education in movement</li>
<li>education through movement</li>
<li>education about movement</li></ul>
<br>
<u>Education in movement</u> involves providing students with specific physical activities that develop efficiency, effectiveness and versatility across complex movement situations. Our PE programme develops in students:
<ul><li>a range of skills through participation in regular and varied physical education experiences, so that they can enjoy movement, discover interests and achieve personal goals.</li>
<li>the competency in movement that facilitates future successful participation in physical activities, leading to an active lifestyle.</li></ul>
<br>
	<u>Education through movement</u> is an avenue for cognitive, affective and social development. Our PE programme develops in students:
<ul><li>the knowledge to make informed decisions such as movement concepts, game rules, tactics, health and fitness-related benefits and personal safety concerns.</li>
<li>the values of resilience, teamwork and fair play so that they learn to work together with others in harmony and be better citizens.</li></ul>

<u>Education about movement</u> addresses the value and benefits of a healthy lifestyle. Our PE program encourages students to:
<ul><li>take purposeful actions in safe physical activities and develop health-related fitness such as muscular strength and endurance, aerobic fitness, flexibility and body composition.</li>
<li>enjoy and value the benefits of physical activities. This is very important because research has shown that students who are engaged physically are more likely o continue and even advocate an active and healthy lifestyle when they enter into adulthood.</li></ul>

<u>Approach</u><br>
Our lower primary level focuses on the development of fundamental motor skills such as locomotor, non-locomotor and manipulative skills through a variety of learning experiences. Our upper primary level focuses on more complex movement combinations and skills application in common sports and games.

The seven learning areas of our PE program are;
<ul><li>Athletics</li>
<li>Dance</li>
<li>Games and Sports</li>
<li>Gymnastics</li>
<li>Outdoor Education</li>
<li>Physical Health and Fitness (previously known as Health Education)</li>
<li>Swimming</li></ul>

<u>Lakers' Friendship Carnival</u>

Our Lakers’ Friendship Carnival involves the entire school population from Primary 1 to Primary 6 students. This carnival provides opportunities for students to forge stronger friendship between junior and senior Lakers. Students are encouraged to take on an active lifestyle and to have a deeper appreciation for the Arts too. Through this experience, students will also build up their skills in decision-making and teamwork.
To engage the students meaningfully, the carnival comprises of four segments, namely Sports &amp; Games, Team bonding, Music and Arts. All these learning experiences are highly student-centric and team-oriented in nature, for our students to learn to work together in teams to achieve common goals.<br><br>

<u>SwimSafer</u>
<br>
SwimSafer is a national water safety program developed to raise the standard of swimming proficiency in Singapore. Through this program, our Lakers develop confidence and independence in the water; learn general and deep-end water safety.

<u>P5 Adventure Camp</u>
<br>
It is an excellent platform for our students to hone the social-emotional learning (SEL) competencies and develop appreciation for each other through teamwork. Through the various teambuilding and outdoor activities, students are able to instil the school values of perseverance and respect. At the same time, they experience the ruggedness and dynamism of being outdoors with nature.<br><br>

<u>Post PSLE iSports (Cycling) Programme </u><br>
All Primary 6 students will participate in our Post-PSLE iSports (Cycling) Programme, designed to equip them with the knowledge, confidence, and skills to cycle safely and proficiently. This programme caters to students of varying skill levels, from beginners to experienced cyclists. Non-cyclists will be guided through a structured and progressive training programme to develop essential cycling skills. As part of the experience, students will have the opportunity to cycle around Jurong Lake Gardens, allowing them to apply their skills in a real-world environment. Through this programme, we aim to nurture cycling as a lifelong skill—one that promotes an active lifestyle, appreciation of nature, and meaningful social interaction.<br>
