<b>Key Programmes and Activities of 2025</b>
<center>Online Overseas Cultural Exchange Programme with Anubansamsen School </center><br>
On 23 July, our Lakers had a meaningful online cultural exchange session with students from Anubansamsen School, a school in Bangkok, Thailand. During the session, students learned more about the cultural aspects of both Thailand and Singapore, fostering cross-cultural understanding and appreciation. They also gained a deeper understanding of environmental sustainability efforts in both countries and explored how they can contribute to more sustainable practices.
