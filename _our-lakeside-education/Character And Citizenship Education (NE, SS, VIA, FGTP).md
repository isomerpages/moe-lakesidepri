<b>Curricular Goals:</b>
<br>
We aim to nurture every Lakeside student to be anchored in values and to develop strong social emotional competencies in them.
<br><br>
<b>Overview:</b>
<br>
The Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) Department provides an array of programmes and activities that provide opportunities for our students to grow in their social emotional (SE) competencies and be anchored in our school values of Love, Perseverance, Responsibility, Integrity, Diligence, rEspect (Lakeside PRIDE). CCE also provides for holistic experiences that will nurture students to be active contributors to Singapore.
<br><br>
The CARe Framework below shows how Personal Qualities (PQs) are centred around our school’s values.
<br><br>
For our students’ CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT, we provide them with platforms (for example, Values-In-Action, PAL Lessons, group work etc) to apply their PQs (APPLICATION). Then, we REVIEW the development of their character through PQ Feedback. Eventually, we aim to EMPOWER them to become an Active Contributor, a Concerned Citizen, a Self-Directed Learner and a Confident Person.
<br><br>
<br><br>
<b>Key Programmes:</b>
<br>
<u>Values-In-Action (VIA)</u><br>
Students participate in VIA specially catered to their levels. VIA aims to help students internalise values learnt through real life experiential activities.
<br><br>
VIA @ Lakeside encompasses 5 domains namely self, family, school, community and nation. Each Lakeside student would have completed 5 domains by the end of Primary 6 and be empowered into becoming, A Lifelong Learner. A Virtuous Leader.
