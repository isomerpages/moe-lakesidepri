<b>Curricular Goals</b>
<br><br>
Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)  is  integral  to  the  holistic  development  of  our students,  leading  to  positive  life  outcomes. Our goal is to nurture our students to be future-ready, develop their character and deepen their values and SEL competencies through a progressive approach.
<hr><br><br>
<b>Overview</b>
<br><br>
CCE provides an integrated approach to addressing our students’ development of values, character, social-emotional well-being and citizenship dispositions in a coherent and holistic way.
<br><br>
The CCE Department provides an array of programmes and experiences that provide opportunities for our students to grow in their learning dispositions and be anchored in our school values of <b>L</b>ove, <b>P</b>erseverance, <b>R</b>esponsibility, <b>I</b>ntegrity, <b>D</b>iligence, and r<b>E</b>spect (<b>L</b>akeside <b>PRIDE</b>). CCE also provides for holistic experiences that will nurture our students to be active contributors to Singapore.

<b>Learning Dispositions</b>
<br><br>
What are Learning Dispositions (LD)? Learning dispositions are positive behaviours and one’s attitudes towards learning. Our Learning Dispositions support our school vision, values and MOE’s 21st century competencies we aim to develop in our students. We have 5 Learning Dispositions – Critical Thinking, Creative Problem Solving, Active Contribution, Leading with Responsibility and Confident Communication.  Our Learning Dispositions are aligned to our school’s vision of ‘A life-long Learner. A virtuous Leader’. <br>
All our Learning Dispositions are undergirded by our school values. Values are at the core of one's character. They shape the beliefs, attitudes and actions of a person. <br>
School experiences avail students the opportunity to develop their LDs and prepare them to be future-ready. Together with the support of our parents and partners, we trust we can develop the learning dispositions of our students and become life-long learners and virtuous leaders.

<b>Values-In-Action</b>
<br><br>
Students participate in Values In Action (VIA), both specially catered to their levels as well as school-wide. VIA aims to help students internalise values learnt through real life experiential activities. Through VIA, students learnt to put values into action as well as develop their LDs.

<b>National Education</b>
<br><br>
National Education (NE) programmes and events evoke in our students the love for Singapore and strengthen their identity as a citizen of Singapore. Holistic experiences are planned during the commemoration of the four core NE events (Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day and National Day). These experiences are not only fun but also meaningful and encourage students to build unity with one another and within their community.

<span style="color:blue;">•</span> Since 1997, the NE show has been organised to instil a sense of pride and belonging in our students and to bring across the significance of National Day. The NE Show is one of the many exciting experiences our P5 students get to enjoy. <br><span style="color:blue;">•</span> We commemorate NE events in meaningful and engaging ways! Here, we have our students dressed up in ethnic costumes as we celebrated racial harmony in our school and our community.</span>

<b>Edusave Character Award (ECHA)</b>
<br><br>
The MOE Edusave Character Award (ECHA) recognises Singaporean students who demonstrate exemplary character and outstanding personal qualities through their behaviour and actions.  This is part of the larger goal to foster an inclusive and stronger Singapore as we broaden the qualities and achievements to be encouraged and applauded. The award also supports our school’s continuing efforts in nurturing students of good value and character, who are active contributors and concerned citizens.
<br>
Similar to the practice for other Edusave awards, ECHA awardees will receive a certificate and an award voucher.  The ECHA award quanta are as follows, depending on the level of study:
