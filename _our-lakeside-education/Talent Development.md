<h5>Talent Development @ Lakeside Primary School<br>
<i>Be A Star, Make A Constellation</i></h5>
<br>
<div style="font-size:14pt;" align="justify">At Lakeside Primary School, we believe every student has the potential to shine. Our tiered talent development approach provides a nurturing, yet, sufficiently challenging environment for our <b>High Ability Learners (HALs)</b> to stretch their thinking, fuel their passion for learning, and grow into <b>Creative Thinkers, Empathetic Leaders, and Lifelong Learners</b>.</div>
<br>
<b>WHY?</b><br>
Through the differentiated talent development engagements, our HALs will:
	<li>Learn how to think deeply and independently</li>
	<li>Build confidence to communicate ideas and solutions</li>
	<li>Take initiative in leading and contributing to school and community causes</li>

<b>WHAT and HOW?</b><br>
We recognise that talents manifest in different forms, so we aim to provide various platforms for every student to grow. Therefore, we  seek to identify, and nurture selected students with high potential in these domains — cognitive, aesthetic, physical, and social, while demonstrating exemplary character and outstanding potential or performance in:
	<li>Subject disciplinarity (e.g., Mathematics, and Science)</li>
	<li>Creative expression (e.g., Visual &amp; Performing Arts)</li>
	<li>Leadership and social responsibility (e.g., CCA Community Leadership Club)</li>

Our talent development framework (see Figure 1 below) is guided by:
	<li>Neihart &amp; Betts’ profiles of gifted learners (2010)</li>
	<li>Treffinger’s Levels of Service model (2004)</li>
	<li>Gagné’s Differentiated Model of Giftedness and Talent (2010)</li>
