<b>Goals:</b>
<br>
Every Laker will be given the opportunity to learn and practice leadership and to develop his / her leadership potential.
<br><br>
<b>Overview:</b>
<br>
At Lakeside Primary, our drive to nurture leaders has evolved to meet ever-changing needs of today’s society. Aligned in our school values, Lakeside students are introduced to personal leadership and get exposed to Leadership concepts. Through school- and level-wide character and leadership programmes (Grow As a Leader—GALE, assembly sharings, e.t.c.) students learn to be responsible and are empowered to take ownership of their attitudes, behavior, emotions and learning by making positive choices. They also learn to appreciate and recognise the leaders in class and in school.
<br><br>
Our student leaders development programmes aim to maximise the leadership potential of all Laker student leaders. We empower them to be active contributors and confident advocates in promoting a positive learning culture, effective leadership and strong school spirit among students. With teachers as mentors, Lakeside student leaders are given opportunities to plan and manage class and/or school activities and be engaged in decision-making.
<br><br>
Our student leaders’ training is framed by the school-based 3C Constructs of Leadership. We aim to nurture our student leaders to become confident individuals anchored in values, and with a keen sense of purpose and commitment. With the progressive leaders appointment, our student leaders will be given the opportunity to develop from a confident leader to a competent leader and a committed leader.

<b>Key Programmes:</b>
<br>
<u>Student Leadership Education and Student Leaders Development</u><br>
The school adopted “The Leader in Me” programme, which is adapted from Stephen Covey’s 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, for our leadership development curriculum. All student leaders will attend training sessions to lead themselves and others. In the first year of their appointment, they will be imparted knowledge and hands-on practice based on the 7 Habits of “The Leader in Me” programme.
<br><br>
In their second and third year as student leaders, prefects and CCA leaders will attend a 2-day Student Leaders’ Camp. In this camp, they will learn to apply and put into practice the 7 Habits, in their projects and student-led activities held as part the school Open House, the school Carnival, the P5 VIA Project and the Teachers’ Day Celebration.
<br><br>
<u>The Prefect EXCO and Head Prefect Elections</u><br>
The Elections running up to the Annual Prefects Investiture provides an authentic learning experience, which complements the school’s efforts in cultivating character and life skills through leadership and values education.
<br><br>
The Prefect EXCO Elections provides Primary 4 and 5 prefect candidates the experience of public speaking and responsible decision-making. During the Elections Campaign Week, identified EXCO candidates will share their leadership experiences, ideas and personal values during school assemblies. Such a platform will allow the head prefect candidates to apply the 3C Leadership Construct of being confident, competent and committed leaders.
<br><br>
<u>Prefects in action</u><br>
Leadership is a craft, best learnt through experiences. In Lakeside Primary, our student leaders are provided numerous platforms to grow their leadership skills.
