Information and Communication Technology Skills
The ICT Department exposes students to ICT skills progressively. In Primary 1 and 2, students will be taught basic touch-typing skills. In Primary 3 & 4, students will be exposed to Scratch, a block-based visual programming language developed by the Lifelong Kindergarten group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
