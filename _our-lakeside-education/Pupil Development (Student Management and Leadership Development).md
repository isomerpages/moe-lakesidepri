<b>Department Goals:</b>
The Pupil Development (PD) Department aims to maintain the positive school tone that encourages students to develop and exercise self-discipline and leadership. This supports the school’s continuous efforts to strengthen positive school culture and enhance pro-social relationships amongst students, teachers and parents.
The PD teams plan and implement programmes that develop and stretch leadership in students and differentiated learning experiences that cater to the needs of different student groups.

<b>Overview</b>
<br>
<u>Discipline / Student Management</u> <br>
Adopting Restorative Practices (RP) as the discipline approach, the PD-Discipline team drives positive and proactive discipline to ensure a safe environment that prevent negative behaviors from happening. As opposed to the traditional punitive measures, the school practices discipline with dignity where disciplinary issues are addressed in a restorative manner, focusing on 
<ul>
<li>students acknowledging their mistakes; </li>
<li>students learning to be accountable of their misconduct and be facilitated to repair the harm caused to others;</li>
<li>he healing of relationships that allows student offenders to be re-integrated into their social communities. </li></ul>
This approach allows students to foster a greater sense of belonging, safety and social responsibility within the school community, enhancing their overall school experiences. <br><br>
<u>Student Leadership Development (SLD)</u><br>
Embracing the school’s philosophy <i>Every Individual C.A.N.</i>, a duo-pronged approach allows all Lakers to be given the opportunity to learn and practice leadership and to develop his / her leadership potential.  Through school- and level-wide character and leadership programmes, students learn to be responsible and are empowered to take ownership of their attitudes, behavior, emotions and choices. They also learn to appreciate and to work with leaders in class and in school.<br><br>

Framed to the school-based <b><i>3C Constructs of Leadership</i></b>, leadership development programmes are planned and implemented to maximise the leadership potential of Laker Leaders, growing them to be active contributors and confident voices that promote leadership, positive learning culture and school spirit among students.

<b>Key Programmes:</b>
<br>
<u>Student Leadership Education and Student Leaders Development</u><br>
The school adopted “The Leader in Me” programme, which is adapted from Stephen Covey’s 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, for our leadership development curriculum. All student leaders will attend training sessions to lead themselves and others. In the first year of their appointment, they will be imparted knowledge and hands-on practice based on the 7 Habits of “The Leader in Me” programme.
<br><br>
In their second and third year as student leaders, prefects and CCA leaders will attend a 2-day Student Leaders’ Camp. In this camp, they will learn to apply and put into practice the 7 Habits, in their projects and student-led activities held as part the school Open House, the school Carnival, the P5 VIA Project and the Teachers’ Day Celebration.
<br><br>
<u>The Prefect EXCO and Head Prefect Elections</u><br>
The Elections running up to the Annual Prefects Investiture provides an authentic learning experience, which complements the school’s efforts in cultivating character and life skills through leadership and values education.
<br><br>
The Prefect EXCO Elections provides Primary 4 and 5 prefect candidates the experience of public speaking and responsible decision-making. During the Elections Campaign Week, identified EXCO candidates will share their leadership experiences, ideas and personal values during school assemblies. Such a platform will allow the head prefect candidates to apply the 3C Leadership Construct of being confident, competent and committed leaders.
<br><br>
<u>Prefects in action</u><br>
Leadership is a craft, best learnt through experiences. In Lakeside Primary, our student leaders are provided numerous platforms to grow their leadership skills.
