<b>Curricular Goals:</b><br>
We aim to develop every student to be an active artist and informed audience, who appreciates and communicates confidently through the Arts. Our students will be able to enjoy, explore and experience the Arts through active engagement in our art and music programmes. Through these programmes, there will be opportunities for students to express their creative voice, empathy, appreciation and excellence through the Arts.<br><br>
<b>Post-PSLE iArts Programme 2024</b><br>
All Primary 6 students take part in an aesthetic module as part of our Post-PSLE iArts Programme. This year, the programme featured a diverse range of modules that students could choose from. These modules included Digital Poster Design, Paper Quilling, Cajon, Kalimba, Hip Hop Dance, and K-Pop Dance. The programme culminated in a showcase of students' newfound skills and creative expression during their Graduation Ceremony.<br>
