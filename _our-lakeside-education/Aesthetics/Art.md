<b>Art Curriculum Overview</b><br>
Aligned to the syllabus, the Lakers’ Art Curriculum aims to enable every child to enjoy art, communicate visually and make meaning through connecting with society and culture. 
Through the integrated domains of See, Express and Appreciate, Lakers are developed to be active artists and informed audience with:
<ul><li>visual inquiry skills to discover and explore their surroundings</li>
<li>curiosity, imagination and enjoyment in art making and art discussions</li>
<li>confidence in working individually and collaborating to formulate ideas and create artworks</li>
<li>awareness of and respect for histories and cultures by appreciating key artworks and artists in Singapore and the world</li></ul>
In this context, students discover the transformative power of art, which not only broadens their perspectives but also shapes their thinking and understanding about our world.<br><br>
Through immersive art processes employing inquiry-based methods, students not only cultivate technical skills but also foster a lifelong enjoyment for and appreciation of artistic expressions.<br><br>
Concurrently, students are empowered to decipher and appreciate the intricate language of visual elements in our visually-driven society.<br><br>

<b>Budding Artists in Action!</b><br>
When students engage in the act of seeing art, they are encouraged to observe their surroundings closely, analyse visual qualities, and reflect on their experiences. This not only enhances their ability to appreciate art but also develops critical thinking skills and a deeper understanding of the artistic elements at play.<br>

When students engage in the process of expressing art, they are encouraged to experiment with various visual elements, generate unique ideas, and explore diverse ways to create both 2-D and 3-D artworks. This creative journey involves students utilizing a range of materials and tools to bring their artistic visions to life either individually or collaboratively.<br>
