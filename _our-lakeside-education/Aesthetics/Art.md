<b>Curricular Goals:</b><br>
We aim to develop every student to be an active artist and informed audience, who appreciates and communicates confidently through the Arts. Our students will be able to enjoy, explore and experience the Arts through active engagement in our art and music programmes. Through these programmes, there will be opportunities for students to express their creative voice, empathy, appreciation and excellence through the Arts.
