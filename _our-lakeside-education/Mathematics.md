<b>Curricular Goals:</b><br><br>
The Mathematics Department is guided by the Curriculum Framework of the Ministry of Education. Our goal is to develop independent and creative problem solvers. Through the syllabus, we aim to enable them to acquire mathematical concepts and skills for everyday use and continuous learning in Mathematics; to develop thinking, reasoning, communication, application and metacognitive skills through a mathematical approach to problem solving and to build confidence and foster interest in Mathematics.<br><br>
<b>Overview:</b><br>
The department plan and deliver our instructions anchoring on the three phases of Mathematics learning in the classrooms.
<br><br>
<u>Phase 1: Readiness</u><br>
We use drills and questioning tactics to tease out prior knowledge and to ascertain readiness to learn.
<br><br>
<u>Phase 2: Engagement</u><br>
We engage students using the Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (CPA) approach. From using concrete manipulatives and learning experiences, students are guided to uncover abstract mathematical concepts or results. We use the following structure: Read-Annotate-Choose-Evaluate (RACE) to develop a problem solving routine in our students.
<br><br>
<u>Phase 3: Mastery</u><br>
We consolidate their learning through structured practices and reviews and the online portal Koobits. We encourage reflective practices by having the students to journal their mathematics learning. We provide opportunities to extend their learning using challenging performance tasks to stretch their thinking and deepen understanding.<br><br>
<br><br>
<b>Key Programmes:</b>
<br><br>
<u>Maths Games</u><br>
Using Mathematics games (eg. Sudoku) to ignite the studentsâ€™ interest in Mathematics. The students compete in completing Sudoku puzzles and they will stand a chance to win prizes.
<br><br>
<u>Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM) Programme</u><br>
The LSM programme is an early intervention effort aimed at providing additional support to pupils who do not have foundational numeracy skills and knowledge.
<br><br>
<u>Mathematics Olympiad</u><br>
Selected students will participate in Mathematics competitions to extend their learning. They will take part in national Olympiad competitions and gain valuable experiences.
