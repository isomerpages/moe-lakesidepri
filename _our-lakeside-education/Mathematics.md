<b>Curricular Goals:</b><br><br>
The Mathematics Department is guided by the Curriculum Framework of the Ministry of Education. Our goal is to develop independent and creative problem solvers. Through the syllabus, we aim to enable them to acquire mathematical concepts and skills for everyday use and continuous learning in Mathematics; to develop thinking, reasoning, communication, application and metacognitive skills through a mathematical approach to problem solving and to build confidence and foster interest in Mathematics.<br><br>
<b>Overview:</b><br>
The department plan and deliver our instructions anchoring on the three phases of Mathematics learning in the classrooms.
<br><br>
<u>Phase 1: Readiness</u><br>
We use drills and questioning tactics to tease out prior knowledge and to ascertain readiness to learn.
<br><br>
<u>Phase 2: Engagement</u><br>
We engage students using the Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (CPA) approach. From using concrete manipulatives and learning experiences, students are guided to uncover abstract mathematical concepts or results. We use the following structure: Read-Annotate-Choose-Evaluate (RACE) to develop a problem solving routine in our students.
<br><br>
<u>Phase 3: Mastery</u><br>
We consolidate their learning through structured practices and reviews and the online portal Koobits. We encourage reflective practices by having the students to journal their mathematics learning. We provide opportunities to extend their learning using challenging performance tasks to stretch their thinking and deepen understanding.<br><br>
<br>
<b>Key Programmes:</b>
<br><br>
<u>Play @ LSPS</u> <br>
Play @ LSPS focuses on on using learning experiences to help the child understand mathematical concepts. Each chapter has its set of learning experiences that the teacher will conduct in the math lessons. It is through the learning experiences that your child gains a deeper understanding of the mathematical concept so as to be able to apply it to the mathematical sums that he/she sees in the practice book or worksheet. Through the year, the mathematics department would also host games such as sudoku for the entire level so do encourage your child to take part and try it out!<br><br> 
<u>Outreach @ LSPS</u><br>
Outreach @ LSPS refers to our learning support for Mathematics where students are taken out during math curriculum time to learn math in a small group setting with a teacher who is specifically trained to give greater support to this group of learners who need more guidance in learning math. We would also be introducing remediation for students in the other classes who do not qualify for LSM but do require additional support. This remediation would take place after school in a small group setting. All students here at Lakeside Primary have also been given a Koobits account. Do let your child explore koobits to do the daily challenge, mission and explore the brain games in there too. It’s so much fun!<br><br> 
<u>Mastery @ LSPS</u><br>
Mastery @ LSPS focuses on stretching our students to their fullest potential by stretching their mathematical knowledge through math competitions like the math Olympiad and engaging them in our e2k math enrichment programme. From time to time, your child’s math teacher would also give some points for reflection in the math notebook for students to think about what they have learnt and how they can apply their knowledge.<br><br> 
<u>Solve @ LSPS</u><br>
Solve @ LSPS refers to honing our students’ problem solving skills through learning heuristics such as model drawing, listing and many more. We have a unique problem solving strategy RACE which refers to Read, Annotate, Choose a Method and Evaluate. Your child would be using this strategy throughout all problem sums so it would be great if you could get your child to share with you this strategy at home! 
<br><br>
<u>Parents’ Partnership @LSPS</u><br>
We hope to work work together with our parents to bring out the best in each child. The following are suggested strategies:<br>
<ul>
<li>Establishing homework routine [homework, revision and koobits]</li>
<li>Work alongside our Maths teachers and communicating with them on your child’s progress.</li>
<li>Building the competencies in the basic concepts through monitoring the completion of skills in Mission in Koobits.</li>
<li>Promote the annotations in their maths workings, especially word problems.</li>
<li>Encourage your child to recall and talk about what they learnt in class for the day.</li>
<li>Encourage your child to learn from his/her mistakes. Be Positive!</li></ul>
