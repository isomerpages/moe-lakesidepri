On 23 July, our Lakers had a meaningful online cultural exchange session with students from Anubansamsen School, a school in Bangkok, Thailand. During the session, students learned more about the cultural aspects of both Thailand and Singapore, fostering cross-cultural understanding and appreciation. They also gained a deeper understanding of environmental sustainability efforts in both countries and explored how they can contribute to more sustainable practices.

The purpose of the visit is to provide opportunities for interaction between the students of both schools, and to help Lakers develop their civil, global and cross-cultural literacy by understanding Thailand’s history, culture and language.

The theme for IFD this year is Singapore in Asia. The theme is maintained to encourage Lakers to play an active role in fostering people-to-people ties, celebrate the region’s diversity and vibrancy and promote the spirit of friendship and collaboration.
