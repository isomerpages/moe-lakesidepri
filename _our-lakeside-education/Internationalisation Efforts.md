<h5>Internationalisation</h5>
Internationalisation programmes provide an extension of learning to deepen students’ acquisition of 21st century competencies and broaden students’ learning experiences through authentic learning. 
In Lakeside Primary School, they provide opportunities for students to: 
-	Increase their socio-cultural and religious sensitivity and awareness
-	Develop communication and collaboration skills with school mates and international peers
-	Deepen their appreciation of Singapore’s context in our region and the world

<b>Key Programmes and Activities of 2024</b><br>
<center>Overseas Cultural Exchange Programme with Anubansamsen School</center>

The purpose of the visit is to provide opportunities for interaction between the students of both schools, and to help Lakers develop their civil, global and cross-cultural literacy by understanding Thailand’s history, culture and language.
<br><br>
Our Lakers took charge by warmly hosting their Thai visitors, introducing them to Singapore's culture by visiting the Geylang Serai Heritage Gallery and sharing the tradition of Batik painting, even gifting them Batik artworks. The Lakers also led the Amazing Race within the school, allowing the visitors to learn about both Singapore's and the school's history in a fun and engaging way.
