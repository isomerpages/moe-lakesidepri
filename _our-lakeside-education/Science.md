<b>Curricular Goals:</b>
<br><br>
A good Science education goes beyond the acquisition of knowledge to the application of Science in our daily lives, society and the environment.
<br><br>
The various Science programmes in our Science department seek to provide our students with these authentic and diverse opportunities to apply scientific concepts in different contexts. 
<br><br>
Following the aims of MOE Primary Science syllabus, the focus of the Science department is to inculcate the spirit of scientific inquiry – developing in students the scientific skills, attitudes, and knowledge to understanding the world and in making responsible decisions.

<b>Overview:</b>
<br><br>
The department engages students in the learning of Science through various learning experiences such as hands-on activities and learning journeys to the Singapore Science Centre.
<br><br>
<u>Science as an Inquiry</u><br>
Scientific investigations are carried out at various degree of inquiry to help students learn Science concepts and develop scientific skills. Students are introduced the Scientific Method and get to experience how scientists carried out investigations and use the findings to explain observations.
<br><br>
<u>Science and Environment</u><br>
Students are given various opportunities to interact with nature through the environment education programme. The various gardens in the school allow students to observe the natural environment to develop the love and sense of responsibility towards nature. Students are also given opportunity to grow vegetables in the garden to learn about the life cycle of plants and food sustainability.  
<br><br>
<u>Thinking like a Scientist</u><br>
Going beyond learning scientific facts, students are equipped with thinking skills like using the framework of CER (Claim-Evidence-Reasoning) to guide them to think like a scientist and to communicate in a scientific way. Students who have strong aptitude in Science are challenge to take up programmes like E2K (Excellence 2000) to extend their learning.
