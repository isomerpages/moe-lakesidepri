<b>Goals:</b>
<br>
We aim to develop programmes, practices and processes to enhance the school experience of every Laker. Through a progressive approach, we hope to cultivate character, deepen values and SEL competencies in our students. We will also work towards fostering of partnerships with stakeholders to provide quality-learning experiences for our students.
<br><br>
<b>Overview:</b>
<br>
The Student Development Team (SDT) oversees the character development and holistic learning experiences of the students.
<br><br>
The SDT comprises three Year Heads (YHs) and three Assistant Year Heads (AYHs). Each Year Head is in charge of two blocks and each Assistant Year Head is in charge of one block. In building a culture of care, SDT partners the Pupil Development and Character & Citizenship Education departments. Collaboratively, the team employs a structured referral system to support the varied learning and behavioural needs of the students.
<br><br>
In enhancing a rich learning environment, SDT looks into providing a myriad of programmes across the levels. Throughout the six years of education with the school, the students undergo programmes of the different domains leveraging on their strengths, discovering their potential and overcoming the challenges. All these experiences contribute towards quality student experiences and outcomes.

<b>Key Programmes:</b>
<br><br>
<u>Orientation Package</u><br>
Our school orientation package provides opportunities for students to learn and adjust back to school life. They will get to interact with their teachers and other students. Setting class rules, teambuilding games and decorating their classrooms are some activities the students are engaged in to foster positive relationships. The package also informs all students about their expected behaviour and responsibilities in school. Most importantly, we aim to help all students to start off right for the year.

<u>Learning Journeys and Outdoor Lessons</u><br>
To enhance the students’ learning experience and to instil joy of learning, the school partners external organisations and agencies to organise outdoor lessons and learning journeys. The lower primary students enjoyed trips to Kidzania Singapore and NLB. The middle primary students went on a learning journey to the frog and vegetable farms while the upper primary students got to experience cultural exposure to places such as Chinatown.
<br><br>
<u>Parents Engagement</u><br>
Parents are our valuable partners in education. The school holds the Meet-The-Parents (MTP) in January and Parent-Child-Teacher-Conferencing (PCTC) in May to engage our parents in the holistic development of their child’s educational journey.
<br><br>
Meeting the parents at the beginning of the year serves as a platform that not only allows the teachers to communicate the expectations to them but it also enables the parents to meet their child’s teachers and establishes a communication channel between both parents and teachers. The principal takes the parents through the school vision, mission and values and key MOE initiatives. Following the briefing in the hall, the parents proceed to the classroom where the form teachers share the school rules, subject-specific information such
