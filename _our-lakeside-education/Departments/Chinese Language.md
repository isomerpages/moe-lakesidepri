<b>Overview:</b>
<br>
We aim to develop confident Chinese language users with 21st century skills. In addition to adopting the strategies based on the 2015 syllabus《欢乐伙伴》, we also extended our students’ learning and application with the use of “Making Thinking Visible” (MTV) routines and various ICT platforms. As our students progress from the lower to upper primary levels, they will be equipped with a set of useful strategies to be a critical and creative thinker, as well as a lifelong learner.

<b>Key Programmes:</b><br>
To inculcate the love of the Chinese language and culture, we have a series of programmes lined up to provide opportunities for students to get exposure and experience the joy of learning.
<br><br>
<u>Extensive and Intensive Reading Programmes</u><br>
To develop the good habit of reading, students are encouraged to read Chinese language books during the daily silent reading sessions. They also have access to picture books guided reading, subscription of magazines and class library. In addition, our programmes partner closely with various programmes, for instance, GROW, Chinese New Year Celebrations and the Mother Tongue Fortnight, so that children apply what they learn in their daily lives.
<br><br>
<u>Drop Everything And Read (DEAR)</u><br>
As part of our Extensive and Intensive Reading Programmes, One Chinese Language period is set aside each month for P1 and P2 students to engage in reading-related activities. The various activities include: reading of storybooks, including picture books, levelled readers and Big Books. MTV routines are infused in the guided reading.
<br><br>
<u>External Competitions</u><br>
We identify key external competitions, including story-telling and story-writing, so that opportunities are available for students with interest to learn more about the different aspects of the Chinese language.
