<b>Overview:</b>
</br>
The Lakeside Primary School Malay Language programme aims to build our studentsâ€™ competency in using the language, as well as developing in them an appreciation for the richness of the culture. In Lakeside Primary School we believe in engaging students to make learning of the Malay Language enjoyable. Our Malay Language teachers use a variety of resources and strategies such as group work to encourage interaction, usage of ICT platforms to encourage self-directed learning, 5W1H strategy as a framework for students to generate details, and Making Thinking Visible (MTV) routines to promote a thinking culture among students.
</br></br>
Reading, listening, writing and oratorical skills are developed through a multitude of activities such as the Extensive Reading Programme (ERP), Cultural Camps, Mother Tongue Fortnight as well as through internal and external competitions.

We also believe in making the language come alive, thus learning is not confined to the classrooms. We create opportunities for authentic learning experience through outdoor learning journeys and culture performances.
