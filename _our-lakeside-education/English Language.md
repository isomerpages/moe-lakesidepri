<b>Curricular Goals:</b>
<br>
We aim to develop students to be effective and confident communicators by cultivating a rich environment to develop reading, writing, listening and speaking skills.
<br><br>
<b>Overview:</b>
<br>
We make use of STrategies for English Language Learning And Reading (STELLAR) to help our students become proficient users of the English Language. The curriculum is divided into two blocks. A set of strategies is used from Primary One to the first semester of Primary Three while another set is used from the second semester of Primary Three to Primary Six.

<b>Key Programmes:</b><br><br>
<u>P1 & P2 Phonics Infusion Programme</u><br>
Recognising the pivotal role that phonics instruction plays in helping students acquire reading skills at an early age, all our Lower Primary students are introduced to phonics formally through a structured Phonics Infusion Programme which aims to give them a good foundation in letter-sound association, blending, segmenting and spellings skills.
<br><br>
<u>Drop Everything And Read (DEAR)</u><br>
1 English period is set aside each week for our students to engage in reading-related activities. The various activities include: reading of storybooks, reading of articles related to the current STELLAR unit, and reading of the 'Little Red Dot' publication by Singapore Press Holdings.
<br><br>
<u>Read to Bond</u><br>
We believe that our students should develop the good habit of reading and we partner our parents in developing this habit. Our Primary One and Two students are given texts that are similar to the Big Books that they read in class. They then bring these parallel stories home and read the stories to their parents. Parents are encouraged to rate their child’s reading.
<br><br>
From Primary Three onwards, our students make use of parallel stories and read them aloud to their peers for feedback.
<br><br>
<u>English Week</u><br>
English Week revolves around a special theme each year. Students explore the selected theme by taking part in the myriad of interesting activities that are conducted in class and in the canteen during recess.
<br><br><br><br>
<u>GROW Library:</u> <br>
The School Library’s role is to be the heart of an ecology of learning which is well equipped with resources to engage students meaningfully.
<br><br>
Our School Library is named Garden Of Wonders (GROW) and our GROW activities are guided by 4 principles:<br>
<ul>
1. Enlivened MINDS: Nurturing a strong reading culture through spaces & programmes<br>
2. Emboldened VOICES: Promoting Collaboration among our students, emphasing on our students’ voices<br>
3. Playful LEARNING: Leveraging on ICT platforms to engage students in reading<br>
4. A Place for Every Child: Meeting the needs of different groups of children.<br></ul><br>
<u>Lakers’ Challenge</u><br>
The GROW Team organises activities in the Media Resource Library to promote the use of the library and promote the love for reading. The GROW Team has launched a Lakers’ Challenge to drive the reading culture forward since 2018.
