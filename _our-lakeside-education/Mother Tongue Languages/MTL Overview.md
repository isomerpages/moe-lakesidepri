<b>Curricular Goals:</b>
<br>
Bilingual education being one of the cornerstone of Singapore’s education system, has a positive effect on intellectual growth and enhances children’s mental development. We strongly believe that learning MTLs:
enable our children to have a deeper appreciation of their own culture
to communicate widely with people and gain broader perspectives
<br><br>
The 2015 MOE MTL new curriculum places greater emphasis on teaching and learning of spoken and written interaction skills. The MTL curriculum also include authentic activities to develop them into proficient language users who communicate effectively and confidently. Through these activities, our students also learn about values and culture. The new curriculum also promotes greater use of ICT to better engage our children in learning MTL.

<b>Key Programmes:</b>
<br>
Mother Tongue Fortnight Activities & Cultural Camp
The MTL Fortnight activities are conducted to create an immersive environment for the learning of MTL. During these weeks, activities are designed to provide platforms for students to actively learn MTL and the associated culture so as to experience MTL as ‘living language’. Such activities include cultural performance, hands-on craft activities, traditional games and food tasting. Students also participate in level competitions related to their respective language and culture. Students often participate in these competitions with excitement and would cheer for their fellow peers. These competitions have also been providing the platforms for students to showcase their hidden talents and to build their confidence level.

<u>Extensive Reading</u>
Extensive reading is carried out in all levels every year to encourage students to read different types of story books for enjoyment and to develop their general reading skills. The team has developed differentiated book review templates for the different levels to capture their understanding of the book they have read. Character First stamps will be awarded to students who have met the set targets.

Conversational Chinese/Malay (CCM) Programme
CCM is an enrichment programme for Primary 3 to Primary 5 students who are interested in learning Chinese / Malay language and culture, other than their own Mother Tongue subject. It aims to help students to learn to converse in daily activities and eventually allow them to pick up the language easily through increased social interaction with native speakers. The programme is funded by MOE and is optional. The CCM programme comprises three 20-hour modules (one Beginner Module and two Basic Modules). Upon completion of the Beginner Module, students will advance to Basic Module 1 in Primary 4 and Basic Module 2 in Primary 5. By the end of the Primary school education, the students would have covered 60 hours of CCM lessons to prepare them for more advanced modules in their Secondary schools.
