<b>Curricular Goals:</b>
<br>
<div align="justify">Bilingual education in Singapore fosters intellectual growth, cultural appreciation, and broader perspectives. The refreshed 2024 Primary MTL curriculum builds on the 2015 framework by emphasizing 21st Century Competencies such as cross-cultural understanding, communication, and critical thinking. It aims to instill a love for Mother Tongue Languages (MTLs), boost students' confidence in using the language for life, and incorporate authentic, relatable materials to enhance engagement. This curriculum is being introduced progressively, starting with Primary 1 in 2024.<br>
Teachers leverage technology and gamified activities to make MTL learning engaging and personalized, allowing students to progress at their own pace even outside the classroom. Parents are encouraged to support learning at home by using these resources, fostering stronger language connections.<br><br>
Immersive programs like Mother Tongue Fortnight and Cultural Camps enrich MTL experiences through activities such as performances, traditional games, crafts, food tasting, and competitions. These activities enable students to explore their heritage, showcase talents, and build confidence in a fun, supportive environment.<br><br>
The Reading Programme promotes a love for reading, improves language proficiency, and enhances critical thinking through guided reading sessions, storytelling, book discussions, and reading challenges. Progress is tracked via reading logs, with milestones celebrated to motivate students. Parents play a vital role by creating a conducive reading environment, engaging in discussions about stories, and modeling a love for reading.<br><br>
The Conversational Chinese/Malay (CCM) Programme gives Primary 3 and 4 students a fun and interactive way to pick up basic conversational skills in Chinese or Malay, enhancing their Mother Tongue Language (MTL) learning. It’s an exciting opportunity to connect with a new language, make friends, and develop a deeper appreciation for diverse cultures —preparing students for meaningful conversations and experiences beyond the classroom!

<b>Key Programmes:</b>
<br>
Mother Tongue Fortnight Activities &amp; Cultural Camp
The MTL Fortnight activities are conducted to create an immersive environment for the learning of MTL. During these weeks, activities are designed to provide platforms for students to actively learn MTL and the associated culture so as to experience MTL as ‘living language’. Such activities include cultural performance, hands-on craft activities, traditional games and food tasting. Students also participate in level competitions related to their respective language and culture. Students often participate in these competitions with excitement and would cheer for their fellow peers. These competitions have also been providing the platforms for students to showcase their hidden talents and to build their confidence level.
<br><br>
<u>Extensive Reading</u>
Extensive reading is carried out in all levels every year to encourage students to read different types of story books for enjoyment and to develop their general reading skills. The team has developed differentiated book review templates for the different levels to capture their understanding of the book they have read. Character First stamps will be awarded to students who have met the set targets.
<br><br>
Conversational Chinese/Malay (CCM) Programme
CCM is an enrichment programme for Primary 3 to Primary 5 students who are interested in learning Chinese / Malay language and culture, other than their own Mother Tongue subject. It aims to help students to learn to converse in daily activities and eventually allow them to pick up the language easily through increased social interaction with native speakers. The programme is funded by MOE and is optional. The CCM programme comprises three 20-hour modules (one Beginner Module and two Basic Modules). Upon completion of the Beginner Module, students will advance to Basic Module 1 in Primary 4 and Basic Module 2 in Primary 5. By the end of the Primary school education, the students would have covered 60 hours of CCM lessons to prepare them for more advanced modules in their Secondary schools.<div>
