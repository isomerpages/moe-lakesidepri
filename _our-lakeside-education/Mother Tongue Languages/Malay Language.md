<b>Overview:</b>
<br>
The Lakeside Primary School Malay Language program aims to enhance students' Malay Language proficiency while fostering an appreciation for the Malay cultural. At Lakeside Primary School, we are committed to creating an engaging and enjoyable learning experience for students learning the Malay Language. Our dedicated Malay Language teachers employ a diverse range of resources and strategies, including group work to encourage interaction, utilization of ICT platforms to facilitate self-directed learning, integration of critical thinking approaches such as Making Thinking Visible (MTV) and the Elements of Thought to cultivate a thinking culture among students.

Reading, listening, writing and oratorical skills are developed through a multitude of programmes. The following are some of our Unit’s signature programmes: <br><br>
a) Reading Programmes<br>
We firmly believe that fostering a love for reading from an early age provides our students with a valuable head start in expanding their vocabulary and cultivating qualities such as independence and self-confidence. Beyond the enhancement of language skills, this practice equips them with the ability to comprehend not only the world around them but also the intricacies of human interactions, contributing to the development of essential social-emotional skills and nurturing their imaginative faculties.<br><br>
Our <b>Extensive Reading Programme</b> is designed to encourage students to immerse themselves in a wide array of Malay books, aiming for a general understanding while fostering a genuine enjoyment of the texts. Emphasizing freedom of choice, students are empowered to select books based on their individual interests, promoting a personalized and engaging reading experience. Access to a diverse collection of books, available for borrowing from the school or class library, further enhances their exploration of different genres and subjects.<br><br>
Complementing this initiative is our <b>Intensive Reading Programme</b>, wherein learners delve into detailed reading with specific learning objectives and tasks. To support this endeavor, the school subscribes to Gen-G, a compact, concise, and relevant publication from Berita Harian tailored for all Primary 4 to Primary 6 Malay language students. Gen-G not only covers significant and captivating news but also showcases students' school activities and essays. Additionally, it incorporates interactive elements like word games, fun activities, and thought-provoking questions, making the learning experience both enriching and enjoyable.<br><br>
The <b>Buddy Reading Programme</b> pairs older Primary 4 and Primary 5 students with younger peers, guiding and coaching them to enhance fluency and overcome reading challenges effectively.
<br><br>
By combining these three reading programs, we strive to provide a comprehensive approach to literacy development that addresses both the pleasure and depth of reading. Our commitment to nurturing well-rounded individuals extends beyond academic proficiency, emphasizing the importance of imagination, critical thinking, and effective communication skills. Through these initiatives, we aim to instill a lifelong love for reading while preparing our students for success in both academic and real-world contexts.<br><br>

b)Competition 
<br>
The Malay Language Unit aims to help students enhance their language skills, motivating them to refine grammar, vocabulary, and communication by encouraging them to partake in language competitions within school as well as inter-school. These competitions also help to foster cultural appreciation, deepening understanding of language-related traditions and heritage. Participation boosts confidence, cultivating public speaking skills and resilience under pressure. Recognition gained from competitions validates hard work and dedication, enhancing students' self-worth. In essence, language competitions support holistic personal and academic growth.

c)	Outdoor Learning and Cultural Exposure <br>
We believe in making the language come alive, thus learning is not confined to the classrooms. We create opportunities for authentic learning experiences in class as well as through outdoor learning journeys and culture performances.
