The Lakeside Primary School Malay Language program aims to enhance students' Malay Language proficiency while fostering an appreciation for the Malay cultural. At Lakeside Primary School, we are committed to creating an engaging and enjoyable learning experience for students learning the Malay Language. Our dedicated Malay Language teachers employ a diverse range of resources and strategies, including group work to encourage interaction, utilization of ICT platforms to facilitate self-directed learning, integration of critical thinking approaches such as Making Thinking Visible (MTV) and the Elements of Thought to cultivate a thinking culture among students.
