<b>Overview:</b>
<br>
<div style="font-size:14pt;" align="justify">The Lakeside Primary School Malay Language program aims to nurture proficient users of the Malay language who can communicate effectively and confidently in both conversation and writing. It fosters students' interest in the language and culture by encouraging them to pursue further studies in Malay beyond primary school, participate in activities and programs related to Malay language and culture, and share their experiences with peers from diverse backgrounds. Additionally, the program instills a sense of pride in their identity by raising awareness of their role as part of Singapore's multicultural society. <br><br>
Our dedicated Malay Language teachers create meaningful and enjoyable learning experiences by fostering interaction through group work, leveraging ICT for self-directed learning, and incorporating critical thinking approaches like Making Thinking Visible (MTV) and Elements of Thought (EOT). They provide opportunities for authentic experiences, making learning fun and demonstrating that Malay is a living language, relevant to studentsâ€™ daily lives.</div>
