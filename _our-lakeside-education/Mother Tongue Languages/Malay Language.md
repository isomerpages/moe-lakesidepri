<b>Overview:</b>
<br>
<div style="font-size:14pt;" align="justify">The Lakeside Primary School Malay Language program aims to nurture proficient users of the Malay language who can communicate effectively and confidently in both conversation and writing. It fosters students' interest in the language and culture by encouraging them to pursue further studies in Malay beyond primary school, participate in activities and programs related to Malay language and culture, and share their experiences with peers from diverse backgrounds. Additionally, the program instills a sense of pride in their identity by raising awareness of their role as part of Singapore's multicultural society. <br><br>
Our dedicated Malay Language teachers create meaningful and enjoyable learning experiences by fostering interaction through group work, leveraging ICT for self-directed learning, and incorporating critical thinking approaches like Making Thinking Visible (MTV) and Elements of Thought (EOT). They provide opportunities for authentic experiences, making learning fun and demonstrating that Malay is a living language, relevant to students’ daily lives.</div>

Reading, listening, writing and oratorical skills are developed through a multitude of programmes. The following are some of our Unit’s signature programmes:
<br><br>
a) <b>Reading Programmes</b>
<br><br>
<div style="font-size:14pt;" align="justify">We firmly believe that fostering a love for reading from an early age provides our students with a valuable head start in expanding their vocabulary and cultivating qualities such as independence and self-confidence. Beyond the enhancement of language skills, this practice equips them with the ability to comprehend not only the world around them but also the intricacies of human interactions, contributing to the development of essential social-emotional skills and nurturing their imaginative faculties.
<br><br>
Our <b>Extensive Reading Programme</b> inspires students to explore a wide range of Malay books, fostering understanding and a love for reading. Students enjoy the freedom to choose books based on their interests, with access to diverse collections from school and class libraries.
At the lower primary level, this programme complements MOE's newly introduced MTL SOAR, which sets aside 30 minutes of curriculum time for Primary 1 and 2 students to engage in reading and library activities. MTL SOAR will be rolled out to all levels by 2029.<br><br>
In addition, our <b>Intensive Reading Programme</b> provides learners with opportunities for detailed reading aligned with specific objectives and tasks. To support this, the school subscribes to Gen-G, a concise and engaging Berita Harian publication for Primary 5 and 6 Malay language students. Gen-G features captivating news, showcases students' activities and essays, and includes interactive elements like word games and thought-provoking questions, making learning both enriching and enjoyable.<br><br>
The <b>Buddy Reading Programme</b> pairs older Primary 4 and Primary 5 students with younger peers, guiding and coaching them to enhance fluency and overcome reading challenges effectively.
<br><br>
By integrating these reading programs, we offer a holistic approach to literacy, balancing enjoyment with depth. These initiatives foster imagination, critical thinking, and communication skills, nurturing a lifelong love for reading and equipping students for academic and real-world success.</div>

b)Competition
<br><br>
<div style="font-size:14pt;" align="justify">The Malay Language Unit aims to help students enhance their language skills, motivating them to refine grammar, vocabulary, and communication by encouraging them to partake in language competitions within school as well as inter-school. These competitions also help to foster cultural appreciation, deepening understanding of language-related traditions and heritage. Participation boosts confidence, cultivating public speaking skills and resilience under pressure. Recognition gained from competitions validates hard work and dedication, enhancing students’ self-worth. In essence, language competitions support holistic personal and academic growth.</div>

c) Outdoor Learning and Cultural Exposure
<br><br>
<div style="font-size:14pt;" align="justify">We believe in making the language come alive, thus learning is not confined to the classrooms. We create opportunities for authentic learning experiences in class as well as through outdoor learning journeys and culture performances.</div>
