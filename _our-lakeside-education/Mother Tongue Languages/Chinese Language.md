<b>Overview:</b>
<br>
We cultivate confident Chinese language users who possess 21st-century skills and embody strong values. Through the "Making Thinking Visible" routines and Paul's Elements of Reasoning, we foster critical thinking that empowers students to become lifelong learners. By integrating ICT tools like virtual reality and curating engaging programs and competitions, we ignite a passion for language and help students express themselves creatively. As they progress, our students emerge not just with fluency, but with the critical and creative thinking skills to navigate the complexities of the world around them.

<b>Key Programmes:</b><br>
To inculcate the love of the Chinese language and culture, we have a series of programmes lined up to provide opportunities for students to get exposure and experience the joy of learning. 
<br><br>
<u>Extensive Reading Programmes</u><br>
To develop the good habit of reading, students are encouraged to read Chinese language books during the daily silent reading sessions. They also have access to guided reading and the class library. Time is set aside fortnightly for P1 and P2 students to engage in reading-related activities. 
<br><br>
<u>Mother Tongue Fortnight and Cultural Camp</u><br>
Language comes with its own unique culture and values. During the Mother Tongue Fortnight and P4 Cultural Camp, we put together a series of programmes and lessons so that students learn and appreciate the cultural aspects of Chinese Language.
<br><br>
<u>Internal and External Competitions</u><br>
We organize internal competitions and identify key external competitions, including story-telling and story-writing, so that students with various interests get exposure to the different aspects of the Chinese language.
