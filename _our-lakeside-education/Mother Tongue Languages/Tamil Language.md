<b>Overview:</b>
<br>
<div style="font-size:14pt;" align="justify">At Lakeside Primary School, our Tamil Language Unit is dedicated to nurturing confident communicators, critical thinkers, and culturally aware students who embrace the richness of the Tamil language and heritage. Through engaging lessons, immersive cultural activities, and innovative teaching methods, including EOTs (Elements of Thoughts), MTV (Making Thinking Visible) routines, differentiation instruction, and e-pedagogy, we inspire a lifelong love for Tamil while equipping students with essential 21st-century skills. <br>
Our vision is to cultivate a deep appreciation for the Tamil language and culture in every student. We focus on developing proficiency in reading, writing, speaking, and listening, while fostering creativity and critical thinking through authentic learning experiences. By promoting cultural pride and appreciation, we encourage students to connect with their heritage and carry these values forward.</div>
