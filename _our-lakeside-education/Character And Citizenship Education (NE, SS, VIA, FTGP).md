<b>Curricular Goals</b>
<br><br>
Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) is integral to the holistic development of our students and supports them in achieving positive life outcomes. At Lakeside, we adopt a progressive and student-centred approach to nurture future-ready learners who demonstrate strong character, sound values and social-emotional competencies. Through intentional teaching, meaningful experiences and guided reflection, we aim to help every student grow into a critical thinker, an empathetic leader and a life-long learner.

<b>Overview</b>
<br>

Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) at Lakeside Primary provides a coherent and holistic approach to nurturing our students’ values, character, social-emotional well-being and citizenship dispositions. Anchored in our school’s <b>LPRIDE</b> values — <b>L</b>ove, <b>P</b>erseverance, <b>R</b>espect, <b>I</b>ntegrity, <b>D</b>iligence and <b>E</b>xcellence — the CCE Department designs and delivers a rich array of programmes and experiences that support the development of confident learners and active contributors.

Through daily interactions, classroom lessons, school-wide initiatives and authentic experiences such as VIA, FTGP, Social Studies lessons as well as National Education commemorations, our students are guided to understand themselves better, care for others, and make decisions grounded in values. These meaningful experiences cultivate positive learning dispositions, strengthen our students’ sense of identity and empower them to be active contributors to their school, community and Singapore.

<b>Form Teacher Guidance Period</b>
<br>

Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) provides dedicated curriculum time for teachers to conduct social and emotional Learning (SEL) lessons, interact with students, and build their social and emotional competencies. Lessons are designed with strategies to acquire competencies that will help students to understand themselves better, learn ways to manage themselves, develop better understanding of their family and friends, learn ways to work with their family and friends and make appropriate and responsible decisions. 
<hr><br><br>
<b>Social Studies</b>
<br>

Social Studies lessons help students to grow in knowledge, develop skills and learn values through examining issues that are of concern to our society and the world in which we live.
Drawing on aspects of society that are of meaning and interest to the students, Social Studies seeks to ignite students’ curiosity to inquire into real-world issues that concern their lives. Through inquiry and authentic learning experiences, Social Studies helps students to attain relevant knowledge and understanding about these issues, develop critical and reflective thinking skills, and appreciate multiple perspectives.
<hr><br><br>
<b>Values-In-Action</b>
<br>

Students participate in Values-in-Action (VIA) programmes that are customised to their developmental levels and complemented by school-wide initiatives. These experiences enable students to put values into practice through authentic, real-life contexts. Through thoughtful planning, reflection and active contribution, VIA helps students internalise the values they learn, develop empathy for others, and understand the impact they can make in their community.

<b>National Education</b>
<br>

National Education (NE) programmes and events evoke in our students the love for Singapore and strengthen their identity as a citizen of Singapore. Holistic experiences are planned during the commemoration of the four core NE events (Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day and National Day). These experiences are not only fun but also meaningful and encourage students to build unity with one another and within their community.

<b>Education and Career Guidance</b>
<br>

Education &amp; Career Guidance (ECG) helps students develop a sense of purpose in life. By nurturing self-awareness and self-directedness for life-long learning, ECG helps students develop a growth mindset, adaptability and a resilient attitude to embrace opportunities and appreciate the value of all occupations. 

As part of our Education and Career Guidance (ECG) efforts, students engage with professionals from various industries to learn more about their work, career pathways and real-world responsibilities. For our lower primary levels, students interact with different staff members in the school to gain insights into the roles they play, as well as the rewards and challenges of their jobs. These authentic conversations help students broaden their perspectives, build appreciation for the people around them and develop early awareness of the world of work.
