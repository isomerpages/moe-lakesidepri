<b>1. Gifted Education Programme (GEP)</b><br><br>

<b>2. Co-Curricular Activities (CCA)</b><br><br>
<b>Q: When will CCAs start and how do students choose their CCA?</b><br><br>
	At Term 1 Week 10, P3 students will undergo the CCA Experience which will help them make informed decisions about their co-curricular participation.
<ul><li>Be exposed to new CCA opportunities</li>
	<li>Gain awareness of the variety of CCAs offered</li>
	<li>Learn to work effectively with others during planned activities</li>
	<li>Develop thinking skills to make informed decisions when selecting a suitable CCA based on their interests</li></ul>
Subsequently, students will make their CCA choices and begin their selected CCA at mid-Term 2. This structured timeline ensures students have adequate exposure and time to consider their options before committing to their chosen co-curricular activity.
