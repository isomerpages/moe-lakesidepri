<div style="font-size:14pt;" align="justify"><h4>Building Blocks of Love: Strengthening Parent-Child Bond – Brick by Brick</h4> 
On Thursday 20 March 2025, Lakeside Primary School held a heartwarming workshop entitled Building Blocks of Love: Strengthening Parent-Child Bond – Brick by Brick, in collaboration with Lakeside Parent Support Group (PSG) and Brick Art Interest Group from Taman Jurong. The event aims to strengthen parent-child relationships through creative, hands-on block-building activities.
<br><br>
The session was facilitated by our PSG Chairperson, Mdm Nurhidayah, together with student leaders from the Community Leadership Club. Both the PSG and student leaders were guided by Mr Lee Aik Lam, Brick Art In-Charge from Taman Jurong, who guided them in how to use brick art as a meaningful medium of expression.
<br><br>
During the workshop, families reimagined a refreshed Lakeside Primary School in the spirit of SG60, building structures that reflected their hopes and dreams for the school’s future. The activity not only sparked creativity but also deepened connections between parents and their children through collaborative play and storytelling.
<br><br>
The workshop also provided a valuable platform for new and experienced parents to connect, while student leaders demonstrated empathetic leadership by assisting participants and ensuring an inclusive, joyful experience—reflecting Lakeside’s holistic approach to character development.
<br><br>
Sven Lager, a Primary 2 student, shared, “It was a meaningful experience spending quality time with my mother and my brother from Primary 1 while learning something new together. We’re proud of our creation!”
<br><br>
The completed masterpieces will be displayed in school as part of the SG60 celebrations, showcasing the creativity, collaboration, and strong community spirit of the Lakeside family.</div>

<h4>Taman Jurong CC SG60 National Day Carnival</h4>
<div style="font-size:14pt;" align="justify">In celebration of Singapore’s 60th National Day, our school proudly partnered with Taman Jurong Community Club to host an SG60 National Day Carnival that brought together students, staff and residents of the community in a joyous spirit of unity and pride.
<br><br>
The event was a meaningful platform for our students to showcase their empathetic leadership, communication and collaboration skills as they planned and facilitated a variety of engaging activities for the community. Through the interactive games, students worked closely with one another and with community partners to ensure that all visitors – from the young to the elderly – felt welcomed and included.
<br><br>
Through this carnival, our students demonstrated not only their creativity and teamwork but also their ability to serve with the heart. They listened attentively to the needs of the community, communicated ideas effectively and collaborated to bring the SG60 celebration to life.
<br><br>
The event was a beautiful reflection of what it means to be Singaporean – united, resilient, and always ready to uplift one another! </div>
