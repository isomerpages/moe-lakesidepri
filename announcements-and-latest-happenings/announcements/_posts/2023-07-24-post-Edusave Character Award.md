Edusave Character Award
<br><br>
The MOE Edusave Character Award (ECHA) recognises Singaporean students who demonstrate exemplary character and outstanding personal qualities through their behaviour and actions.  This is part of the larger goal to foster an inclusive and stronger Singapore as we broaden the qualities and achievements to be encouraged and applauded. The award also supports our schoolâ€™s continuing efforts in nurturing students of good value and character, who are active contributors and concerned citizens.
<br><br>
Similar to the practice for other Edusave awards, ECHA awardees will receive a certificate and an award voucher.  The ECHA award quanta are as follows, depending on the level of study:
<table style="border: 1px solid rgb(42, 42, 42); width: 773px;">
<tbody><tr>
<td width="128" style="padding: 5px; text-align: center; border: 1px solid rgb(42, 42, 42);">Levels</td>
<td width="129" style="padding: 5px; text-align: center; border: 1px solid rgb(42, 42, 42);">Award Quantum</td></tr>
