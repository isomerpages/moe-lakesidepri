<h4>Direct School Admission (DSA) Webinar- Question &amp; Answer Segment</h4>
<p>We would like to thank all parents for your participation in the DSA webinar
on 26 April 2024. Please refer to the responses for the questions that
were surfaced by parents during the webinar but were not addressed then.</p>
<p><strong>Q1</strong>: What school is the best if my child/ward is keen
on applying DSA using Choir CCA?</p>
<p>Every school is a good school. It really depends on your child’s interest
and ability to cope with the academic rigour of the school. Do have conversations
with your child/ward to decide on the school that best fits your child/ward’s
interest and ability. You could refer to our collated list for DSA by Lakeside
(uploaded on Parents’ Gateway on 29 April 2024) to look at which schools
in our area offer Choir CCA.</p>
<p><strong>Q2</strong>: What if my child is having a CCA that does not have
a DSA area he/she can apply to?</p>
<p>As shared during the webinar, it is fine to apply for a DSA area that
does not have an exact match with the child’s CCA. The skillset acquired
by the child during the CCA can enable him/her to apply for a similar area.
For example, if the child is in Rope-Skipping CCA, he/she can apply for
sports-related DSA area such as basketball or Cross-Country if he/she is
keen and has the talent in these two areas. It is important to keep an
open mind and explore similar areas. Values such as perseverance and teamwork
learnt during the CCA would steer the child in good stead when he/she undergoes
the interview sessions or trials conducted by the respective DSA-SEC schools.</p>
<p><strong>Q3</strong>: What if my child did not get a confirmed offer for
DSA?</p>
<p>For students who applied for DSA but did not get a confirmed offer by
the DSA-SEC school, he or she is still eligible to participate in the Secondary
One (S1) posting exercise after the release of PSLE results. The following
explains the different DSA outcomes:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Confirmed Offer (CO) - Your child has a place reserved in the school,
as long as his/her PSLE results qualify him/her for the school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wait List (WL) - Your child will be given a place in the school if other
students with Confirmed Offers do not take up those offers, and if his/her
PSLE results qualify him/her for the school. Allocation will be based on
students’ rank on the school’s Wait List.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unsuccessful - Your child has not been given a place in the school. If
your child still wishes to enter the schools he/she applied for, he/she
can apply through the S1 Posting process using his/her PSLE results.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Do note that the following schools do not participate in the S1 posting exercise:</em>

</ul>
<p><strong>Q4</strong>: Is there any DSA-SEC schools for external activities
such as Piano?</p>
<p>Your child can apply for piano DSA under Music or Performing Arts. Do
have a look at the MOE website on DSA; <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/schoolfinder" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.moe.gov.sg/schoolfinder</a> or
our collation of DSA-SEC schools near Lakeside Primary School(uploaded
