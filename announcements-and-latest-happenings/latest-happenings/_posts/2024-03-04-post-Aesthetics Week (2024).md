Aesthetics Week in Term 1, Week 10, was a vibrant celebration of creative hearts and talented stars in our school. As part of our LLP StarswitHeARTs, bustling performances by our talented student buskers, our first alumnus Donovan Siew from Fuhua Secondary School, and engaging fringe activities like “Sing a Song, Sing Along,” the “Feel the Beat, Move Your Feet” dance session, and the exhilarating AMUSE ESCAPE ROOM filled the atmosphere with dynamic artistic energy.

Our confident student buskers demonstrated how they were active contributors and communicators to the arts culture in the school by showcasing their unique areas of interest with passion and dedication. They inspired students to participate enthusiastically in various captivating arts activities, including writing encouragement cards and earning stamps for bingo cards through active participation during the week. Their collective efforts clearly show how our responsible Lakers took charge and made a positive difference, creating a memorable and uplifting experience for all.
