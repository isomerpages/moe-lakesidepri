<div style="font-size:14pt;" align="justify">Our Primary 5 students returned from their first Outdoor Adventure Camp with excitement, confidence and unforgettable memories. Designed to develop adaptive thinking, self-management and teamwork, the camp challenged students to step out of their comfort zones and grow through authentic outdoor experiences, while instilling environmental responsibility through the Leave No Trace principles.
<br><br>
Over three action-packed days, students journeyed through East Coast Park, tackled team challenges, conquered high and low elements such as ziplining and abseiling, enjoyed “Sun, Sand and Surf” activities, learnt kayaking, and bonded during night activities.
<br><br>
Through these experiences, they learnt to collaborate, persevere and support one another, emerging more resilient and self-assured. We are proud to recognise 24 Best Campers who modelled the camp values and inspired their peers through their actions.
<br><br>
This camp truly embodied our school’s spirit—“Take Charge and make a positive difference!”</div>
