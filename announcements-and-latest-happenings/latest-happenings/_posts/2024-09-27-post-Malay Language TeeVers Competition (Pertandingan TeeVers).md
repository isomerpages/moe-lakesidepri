Jointly organised by Malay Language Council and  TeeVers, the competition aims to enhance the oral expression skills of students and share the love of the Malay Language.  Each school are represented by 2 Rakan Bahasa (Friends of the Language). Students produced a 3-minute audio drama based on the competition theme, ‘Family’.  The student’s submission was then evaluated based on the content, creativity and the effective use of the Malay Language.  Through hard work and dedication, Lakeside Primary won 2nd place in the Primary Category.
