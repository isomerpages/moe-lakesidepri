<div style="font-size:14pt;" align="justify">The theme for International Friendship Day is Strengthening Friendships Across Cultures in a Complex World. It encourages students to take charge by taking the initiative to foster meaningful connections with others and to appreciate diverse cultures and perspectives. By doing so, students will be better equipped to contribute to a cohesive and globally connected society. 
<br><br>
Our school organised a variety of activities to provide students with an engaging and meaningful experience to deepen their understanding of our connections with other countries and strengthen friendships within the school community.</div><br>
