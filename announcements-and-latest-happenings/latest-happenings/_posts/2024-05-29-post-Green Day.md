On 29 April, our school celebrated Green Day with the theme "Take Charge and Be an Eco-Champion". Highlights of the celebration include a sharing by Principal Mrs. Liang on her journey to becoming an eco-champion, a chinese poem recitation "If" by P6 student Yong Yi Lu and an engaging presentation by Ms Amanda on 10 tips to protect the Earth during assembly. During recess, our students also participated in fun learning activities about proper recycling and pledged to be eco-champions."
