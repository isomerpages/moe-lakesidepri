Organized by the South West CDC, this programme recognizes the school’s efforts in educating and instilling environmental responsibility in students throughout 2024. This marks our second consecutive year achieving this recognition.
<br><br>
Throughout the year, our students actively participated in various initiatives to raise awareness of environmental challenges and develop a strong sense of responsibility for sustainability. These included Green Day activities, whole-school recycling drive, and classroom presentations by environment monitors on the dangers of dengue.</div>
