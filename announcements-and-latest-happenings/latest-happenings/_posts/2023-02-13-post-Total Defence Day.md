We commemorated Total Defence Day (TDD) on 13 February 2023. The theme for TDD this year is Together We Keep Singapore Strong. The theme is maintained to encourage students to play a greater role in Total Defence and to highlight the different ways they can contribute. 
<br><br>
Our school conducted a variety of activities to create an engaging and meaningful experience for students to deepen their understanding of the core message of everyone standing together, with each playing our part to protect Singapore and our shared way of life.
