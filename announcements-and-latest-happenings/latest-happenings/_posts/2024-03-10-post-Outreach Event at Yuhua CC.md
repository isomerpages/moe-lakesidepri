As part of our school’s community outreach, 5 of our P5 students (4 Environment Monitors and 1 Prefect) joined the Jurong residents at Yuhua Community Club in their International Women’s Day Celebration on 10 March 2024. Our students set up a sustainability booth to showcase their upcycling projects. Participants were excited to learn from our students how to upcycle an unwanted T-shirt into a tote bag or necklace and turn a plastic bottle into a self-watering planter, and made their pledge to upcycle and do their part for the environment.
