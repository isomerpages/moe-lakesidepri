The Primary Three Little Thinkers Camp was carried out from 24 April to 26 April. During the camp, students were engaged in a Design Thinking group project and ICT training in Generative AI. For the CCA Experience segment, they were engaged in sports, dance, and drama activities. Students were able to apply their adaptive and inventive thinking skills to creatively solve problems, communicate information, ideas, and feelings to their peers respectfully.
