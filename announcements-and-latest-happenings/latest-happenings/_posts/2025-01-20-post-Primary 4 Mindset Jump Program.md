<div style="font-size:14pt;" align="justify">On 20 Jan 2025, the Primary Four students participated in the Mindset Jump Programme. During the session, they played a mindset board game and learned about the differences between a growth mindset and a fixed mindset. Students also had the opportunity to build rapport and develop stronger friendships with their peers. </div>
