<div style="font-size:14pt;" align="justify">Our school was filled with festive cheer as we celebrated Hari Raya with a meaningful and memorable assembly programme titled "Raya Millenia". The programme took the audience on a journey through time, exploring how Hari Raya has been celebrated in the past, present, and imagined future. Through engaging skits and student reflections, the event highlighted how the traditions of Hari Raya continue to evolve while keeping its core values of family, gratitude, and community alive.
<br><br>
A key highlight of the celebration was a vibrant Hari Raya dance performance by former Malay Dance CCA members. Their return to the stage brought a sense of nostalgia and pride, as they performed traditional dances with a modern twist that captivated the audience.
<br><br>
The celebration not only honoured cultural heritage but also fostered greater understanding and unity within our school community. It was a truly special event that reminded us of the beauty of tradition and the importance of moving forward together.</div>
