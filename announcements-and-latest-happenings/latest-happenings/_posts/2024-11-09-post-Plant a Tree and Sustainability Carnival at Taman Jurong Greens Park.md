On Saturday, 9 November, Lakeside Primary School participated in the launch of the Taman Jurong Oasis: Plant a Tree and Sustainability Carnival at Taman Jurong Greens Park. The event, held from 8.30am to 11.30am, brought together school leaders, SAC members, staff, students, and parents for a meaningful community programme. Our Environment Monitors set up a booth to promote sustainability. They showcased creative art pieces made from natural elements and shared tips on green practices. The event was graced by Mr Huang Wei Zhong Shawn, Elected Member of Parliament for Jurong GRC, as the Guest of Honour. We invite you to enjoy a video montage of the dayâ€™s highlights and special moments.
