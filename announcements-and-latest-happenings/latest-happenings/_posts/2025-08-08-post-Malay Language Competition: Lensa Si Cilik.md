<div style="font-size:14pt;" align="justify">The ‘Lensa Si Cilik’ Competition, supported and funded by MLLPC, is an annual national event hosted by White Sands Primary School. This competition aims to foster a deeper appreciation of the Malay Language by encouraging creative expression through the exploration of proverbs. Participants are challenged to produce a one-minute short story video that creatively incorporates a proverb through role-play. Our school was assigned the proverb "Bagai tikus membaiki labu" and our team delivered a strong performance to convey its meaning. We are proud to be awarded the Top 5 Gold Award.</div><br>
