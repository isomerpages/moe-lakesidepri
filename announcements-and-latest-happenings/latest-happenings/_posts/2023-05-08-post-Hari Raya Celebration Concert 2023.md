The school had its Hari Raya Celebration concert on 8th May 2023. Our students were entertained with cultural performances put up by the Dikir Barat and Malay Dance. Beside this, our students took part in a quiz on Malay culture.
<br><br>
The concert finale is a dance item. Our students were given a surprise with the appearance of the school principal, vice-principal and teachers donned in beautiful kebaya and baju kurung while dancing to the tune of famous Hari Raya songs!
<br><br>
Beside the concert, our students learned more about Hari Raya and Malay culture through a static display in the school foyer.  The display items were loaned from the National Heritage Board (NHB).
