Four teachers and twenty-nine students from Shaanxi Xi’an Gaoxin No.1 Primary School, Xi’an,
Republic of China, visited Lakeside Primary School on 11 July 2024. The objectives are to:
<li>Promote understanding and respect between our Lakers and the Chinese students for each
other's cultures, customs, and ways of life;</li>
<li>Develop our Lakers' abilities to communicate and collaborate in multicultural settings; and</li>
<li>Help our Lakers broaden their international perspectives and enhance their awareness as global citizens.</li>
Our Lakers took charge by warmly hosting our Chinese visitors, introducing them to Singapore's
culture and education, and even gifting them with some of our local food. Our Lakers also
conducted the school tour; thus, allowing the visitors to learn more about the school's history
and total curriculum in a fun and engaging way.
