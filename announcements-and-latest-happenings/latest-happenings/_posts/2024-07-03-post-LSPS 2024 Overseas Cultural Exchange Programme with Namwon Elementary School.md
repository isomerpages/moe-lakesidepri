The principal, teachers and students from Namwon Elementary School visited Lakeside Primary School on 3 July 2024. The purpose of hosting the Koreans is part of our school’s local-based internationalisation activities to provide authentic learning opportunities for our Lakers to develop 21st century competencies through understanding the history, culture, and language of South Korea; and interacting with their Korean peers.
