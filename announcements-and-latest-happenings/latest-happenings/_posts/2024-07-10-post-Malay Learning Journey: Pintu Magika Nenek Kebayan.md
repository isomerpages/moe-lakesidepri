On 10 July, a Primary 5 ML student had the unforgettable experience of watching 'Pintu Magika dan Nenek Kebayan' at Wisma Geylang Serai. The show, filled with laughter and excitement, brought Malay folktales to life as students followed the journey of a lost boy who discovered a magical door leading to a realm of legendary warriors, spirits, and mythical creatures. Guided by the mystical Nenek Kebayan, they learned valuable lessons and celebrated the richness of Malay folklore. Some of our students had the opportunity to participate as one of the characters, enhancing their knowledge and appreciation of their cultural heritage. The atmosphere was vibrant, with a sporting audience, making the event both educational and entertaining.
