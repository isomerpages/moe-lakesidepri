<div style="font-size:14pt;" align="justify">The Young Playwright Presents is a segment of the Singapore Youth Festival 2025 Celebrations, offering young playwrights the opportunity to write and perform their own monologues. This year’s theme is ‘Building Our Singapore Together’.
<br><br>
We are proud to share that Speech and Drama CCA participated in this initiative, and two of our school's entries, Wee Joy Xuan (5 Respect) and Emerlyn Tong Xi Teng (4 Respect), have been shortlisted to be featured on the official SYF YouTube channel!
<br><br>
In her monologue, Joy takes on the role of Singapore itself, reflecting on the nation's transformation through the years. Meanwhile, Emerlyn brings us into the world of Max, a time-traveller whose journey inspires a culture of recycling in Singapore.
<br><br>
Congratulations to Joy and Emerlyn on this exciting achievement!
