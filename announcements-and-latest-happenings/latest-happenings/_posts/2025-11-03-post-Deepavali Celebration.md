<div style="font-size:14pt;" align="justify">This year’s Deepavali celebration at our school was a vibrant and meaningful occasion where students came together to celebrate the Festival of Lights while deepening their appreciation of Indian culture and its significance. The celebration aimed to help students understand the values behind Deepavali—light over darkness, good over evil—and relate them to personal growth, positive mindset, and caring for our environment. 
<br><br>
The highlight was an engaging skit titled “The Forgotten Festival.” Set in a futuristic and dystopian world, the performance told the story of a family who travelled back in time to rediscover the joy, warmth, and values of Deepavali. 
<br><br>
During recess, students enjoyed hands-on activities such as mixture-making and henna art, which fostered teamwork and cultural understanding. This year’s focus on sustainability encouraged students to reflect on caring for the environment by reusing materials and reducing waste. The celebration reminded everyone to be a light—spreading kindness, respect, and positive change in our community.</div><br>
