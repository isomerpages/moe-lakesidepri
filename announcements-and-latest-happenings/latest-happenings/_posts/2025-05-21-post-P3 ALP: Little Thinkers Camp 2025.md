<div style="font-size:14pt;" align="justify">As part of the ALP programme, students participated in the Little Thinkers Camp, where they applied design thinking to tackle waste management issues through an authentic and multi-disciplinary learning experience. The cohort was divided into groups and embarked on learning journeys that saw them visit a varietyof locations, including an e-waste facility, paper recycling plant, wood upcycling factory, and the Sustainable Singapore Gallery. They gained real-world insights before creating prototypes and presentations to advocate for responsible waste management habits in Lakeside. The programme, integrated with Social Studies, English, and ICT tools like Google Slides and Padlet, also developed students’ 21st Century Competencies such as adaptability, communication, and collaboration.</div>
