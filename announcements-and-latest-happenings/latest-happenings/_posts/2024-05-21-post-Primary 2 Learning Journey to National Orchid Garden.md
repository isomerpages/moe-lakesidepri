Our Primary 2 students visited the National Orchid Garden to learn about the many types of orchids, especially Singapore's national flower, Vanda Miss Joaquim, which symbolizes the nation's resilience and unity. They took charge by displaying the right park etiquette as they explore historic landmarks preserved for over 160 years.
