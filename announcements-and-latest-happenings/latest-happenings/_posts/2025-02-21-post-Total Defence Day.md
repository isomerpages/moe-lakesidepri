	In line with the SG60 theme, Building our Singapore Together, Total Defence Day encourages students to take a more active role in Total Defence and highlight the various ways they can contribute to keeping Singapore strong. 
<br><br>
Besides conducting an assembly talk and engaging our Peer Support Leaders as well as the ICT monitors to educate their peers about Digital Defence &amp; Cyber Wellness, students also experienced a power disruption simulation in school on 21 February 2025. 
<br><br>
Through these experiences, students deepened their understanding of the core message—everyone must stand together, take responsibility and play their part in protecting and building Singapore.</div>
