Two (associate) professors and eleven student-teachers from Joetsu University of Education,
Niigata, Japan, visited Lakeside Primary School on 12 September 2024.
The objectives are for our Lakers to:
<li>Interact respectfully with others to share information and ideas on global issues while
accepting differences in views; and</li>
<li>Demonstrate awareness and acceptance of the cultural heritage and customs of different
cultural and religious communities.</li>
Our Lakers took charge by warmly hosting the Japanese visitors, interacting politely with them
and explaining patiently to them what their ICT-enhanced learning experiences were like; thus,
allowing the visitors to learn more about and the school's total curriculum in a meaningful and
engaging way.
