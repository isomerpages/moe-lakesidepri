<div style="font-size:14pt;" align="justify">On 23 July, our Lakers had a meaningful online cultural exchange session with students from Anubansamsen School, a school in Bangkok, Thailand. During the session, students learned more about the cultural aspects of both Thailand and Singapore, fostering cross-cultural understanding and appreciation. They also gained a deeper understanding of environmental sustainability efforts in both countries and explored how they can contribute to more sustainable practices.</div>
