<div style="font-size:14pt;" align="justify">Our school proudly celebrated National Day on Friday, 8 August, with an extra special twist this year! Joining us were not only Mdm Soh Xiu Feng and Mr Darren Wong from the School Advisory Committee and supportive parents from the Parent Support Group, but also our international guests from Suzhou Xiangcheng No.1 Experimental School!
<br><br>
The celebration was packed with exciting highlights — from a heartfelt Observance Ceremony and a vibrant National Day concert to lively fringe activities during recess. Primary 5 students also enjoyed an engaging National Education Show, deepening their understanding of what National Day and active citizenship truly mean!</div><br>
