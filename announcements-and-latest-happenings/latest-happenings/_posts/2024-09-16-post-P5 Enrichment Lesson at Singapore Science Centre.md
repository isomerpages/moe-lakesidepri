In an exciting hands-on lesson at Singapore Science Centre, Primary 5 students explored the concepts of forces by building and testing structures. Working in groups, they learned about friction, balance, and different types of forces that act on buildings, including gravity and resistance to extreme forces like earthquakes. The students had lots of fun while gaining valuable insights into how real-world structures are engineered to remain stable under challenging conditions.
