<div align="justify">The SRRS programme ensures a smoother transition back to school by adopting a differentiated, level-specific approach that emphasizes active engagement. Aligned with the principles of the Caring and Enabling School Environment (CESE), SRRS provides meaningful opportunities for students to interact, strengthen peer connections, and build positive relationships with their teachers. Through engaging activities, students are empowered to reconnect, fostering a sense of belonging and readiness for a successful year ahead.</div><br>
