The school commemorated Racial Harmony Day on 15 July, Monday. A series of exciting activities (e.g., assembly show, CCE (FTGP) lessons) was conducted for the students to deepen their understanding on the appreciation of the diverse races and religions that make up our multicultural society.

Through the experience, the students took charge and played their part to make Singapore a harmonious society and to promote social cohesion. <br><br>
