The Primary 6 Graduation Ceremony was held on 13 November. It aims to celebrate the six-year learning journey of the students in Lakeside through a showcase of their talents in the varied art forms and a walk down memory lane that features the involvement of the students in school activities from Primary 1 to 6. The ceremony also saw teachers penning their heart-warming wishes for the students and students sharing their thoughts and feelings about their journey in Lakeside. The ceremony ended with the presentation of graduation bears and vouchers to the students with the graduation song “A Million Dreams” in the background. Happy Graduation to our 2024 Primary 6 cohort! May you pursue your dreams and all the best in your secondary schools!
