<div style="font-size:14pt;" align="justify">As part of the P4 Applied Learning Programme, students explored the theme of food security through a series of meaningful experiences. From planting onions as part of Science lessons to orienteering during a Physical Education lesson to find suitable spaces around school, learning was hands-on and engaging. A highlight was the visit to Nippon Koi Farm during the first day of our Little Explorers Camp (27–29 May 2025), where students discovered how the farm supports Singapore’s food sustainability. Back in school, students utilized the Design Thinking phases to ideate, prototype their eco-plot designs using LEGO and presented their ideas with the use of GoogleSlides. Through this, our students developed key 21st Century Competencies of adaptive thinking, collaboration and communication.</div>
