<div style="font-size:14pt;" align="justify">As part of our ongoing efforts to nurture respectful and responsible digital citizens, our Primary 4 ICT Monitors and Primary 5 Peer Support Leaders have come together to create a meaningful Cyber Kindness Campaign video, themed <i>“Every Click Counts, Every Post Matters.”</i>
<br><br>
This student-led video highlights the importance of showing kindness and making thoughtful choices in the digital space. It serves as a reminder that our actions online whether big or small can leave a lasting impact on others.
<br><br>
<b>Every click counts. Every post matters.</b><br>

We encourage all parents to watch the video together with your child or children, and have a conversation about how we can all contribute to a safer, kinder online world starting with the choices we make every day.

Let’s work together to build a positive digital culture in our school and beyond!</div>
