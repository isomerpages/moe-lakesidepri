The Teachers' Day celebration at Lakeside was a vibrant and heartwarming event that celebrated the dedication of our teachers while 
showcasing student talents. 
<br><br>
The day started with a private concert in the foyer where teachers enjoyed a variety of performances by our student performers over a sumptuous Nonya kueh breakfast.
<br><br>
In the classrooms, students engaged in creative activities, decorating their classroom whiteboards and personalizing gifts for their teachers, followed by a trivia quiz and fun-filled Minute-to-Win-It games. Kudos to our prefects and Parent Support Group volunteers for leading the classroom activities.
<br><br>
This celebration not only honoured the hard work of our teachers but also fostered a sense of gratitude amongst our students.
