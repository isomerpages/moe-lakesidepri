We commemorate International Friendship Day (IFD) on 8 April 2024. The theme for IFD this year is Singapore in Asia. The theme is maintained to encourage students to play an active role in fostering people-to-people ties, celebrate the regionâ€™s diversity and vibrancy and promote the spirit of friendship and collaboration.

Our school conducted a variety of activities to create an engaging and meaningful experience for students to deepen their understanding of the relations that we share with other countries.
