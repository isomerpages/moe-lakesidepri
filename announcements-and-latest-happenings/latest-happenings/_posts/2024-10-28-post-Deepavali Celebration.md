The Deepavali celebration, or ‘Festival of Lights,’ held during assembly on 28 October, promoted cultural awareness and critical thinking. It began with a dance drama illustrating Deepavali’s origins, followed by a quiz that encouraged active engagement and enhanced information literacy about the festival. This year’s highlight was busking performances during all three recesses, where students showcased traditional Indian music and dance. This fostered collaborative skills and global awareness as students and staff of diverse backgrounds enjoyed Indian culture. In classrooms, Tamil students engaged in creativity-focused activities like Kolam designing and Deepavali card-making, deepening their cultural competency through hands-on learning.
