Our P1 Orientation Programme welcomes new students and parents to Lakeside Primary School. Little lakers enjoy interactive games and activities to help them acclimate to their new environment. Parents attend informative talks on the school routines and supporting their children in the transition. See you in 2025!

Please share your feedback on the orientation with us -
