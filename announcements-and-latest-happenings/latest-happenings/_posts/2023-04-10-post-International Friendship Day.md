We commemorate International Friendship Day (IFD) on 10 April 2023. The theme for IFD this year is Singapore in Asia. The theme is maintained to encourage students to play an active role in fostering people-to-people ties, celebrate the region’s diversity and vibrancy and promote the spirit of friendship and collaboration.
<br><br>
Our school conducted a variety of activities to create an engaging and meaningful experience for students to deepen their understanding of the relations that we share with other countries.
