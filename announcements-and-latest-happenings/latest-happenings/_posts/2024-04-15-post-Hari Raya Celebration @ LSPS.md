The Hari Raya celebration at our school was nothing short of electrifying! Kicking off during Mother Tongue Fortnight Week, we dove headfirst into the vibrant tapestry of Malay culture. From mastering the art of khat calligraphy to crafting intricate ketupat and delicious kuih raya, every moment was a burst of excitement and learning. The festivities reached a crescendo with an enchanting dance performance by Sri Warisan Performing Arts Ltd, transporting us into the heart of Malay traditions. Reflecting on the experience, students unanimously expressed newfound knowledge and appreciation. A craft-making competition added to the thrill, culminating in a dazzling display of creativity and cultural significance. Truly, a celebration to remember!
