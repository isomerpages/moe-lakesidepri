The "Start Right, Right from the Start" programme for Primary 1 students on their first day of school is designed to ease the transition into formal education. The day begins with an informative panel question and answer session, allowing parents to address any concerns. Parents then meet their children's form teachers, establishing crucial first connections. The students and parents participate in an engaging orienteering game in small groups, fostering friendships and familiarising themselves with the school grounds. A unique feature of the day, is the shared recess with parents, providing comfort and support as the young Lakers navigate their new environment.<br><br>
