<div style="font-size:14pt;" align="justify">Green Day was held on 21 April to promote energy sustainability and inspire students to take action for a greener future.
Highlights included an engaging assembly by LTA, a sharing on our school’s solar panels by our Science HOD Ms Audrey Cheong, and a fun Blooket recess game supported by our PSG. Our Environment Monitors also presented a TED Talk on saving energy, based on their observations around the school. Falisha (P5) shared, “It feels good to make a difference, even with small actions.” Don’t forget — the Eco-Hunt Padlet Challenge is still on! Spot eco-friendly habits at home and in your neighbourhood!</div>
