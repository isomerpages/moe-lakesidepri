<div style="font-size:14pt;" align="justify">To showcase our students’ talents and contribute to the community, the school’s Guzheng Ensemble was invited to perform at the opening ceremony of the Mid-Autumn Festival celebration at Jurong Lake Gardens, presenting a wonderful guzheng performance for the public. The ensemble performed “Song of Harvest” and “Milking Dance.”
<br><br>
Our guzheng coach, Mdm Yin Qun, who is also the President of the Singapore Guzheng Association, was invited to perform on stage together with Leong Yi Fang. They played the guzheng classic “Fisherman’s Song at Dusk,” which received warm applause from the audience.</div><br>
