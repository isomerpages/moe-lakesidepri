The school celebrated National Day on 8 August. As part of the celebration, staff, parents, and students came to school dressed in red. <br>
A series of exciting activities (e.g., Observance Ceremony, National Day concert, story-telling sessions, National Day Parade Show for P5 students, inter-class games for the lower primary students) was carried out. <br>
Through these activities, it is hoped that it will evoke our common Singapore identity and for all Singaporeans to move onward together in building our shared future as one united people. <br><br>
