Our Primary 5 students immersed themselves learning about Computational Thinking and Coding through the Code for Fun Programme. Students learned hands-on basic programming concepts using Sphero robots such as events, loops, variables, and functions. Using the Sphero robots, students worked in groups to program dances together, making learning interactive and fun. By breaking down problems into manageable pieces, they developed problem-solving skills and logical thinking. Additionally, this year, our Primary 5 students were introduced to both the benefits and dangers of generative artificial intelligence during Code For Fun.
