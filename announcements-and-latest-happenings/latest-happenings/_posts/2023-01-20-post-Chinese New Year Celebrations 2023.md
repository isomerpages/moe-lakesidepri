For this Year of the Rabbit, students, staff and PSG members of Lakeside Primary were entertained with a variety of activities during the CNY celebrations. During the assembly programme in the hall, everyone was captivated by the Wushu performance, Chinese dance, and the all-time favorite, lion dance. 
<br><br>
During recess, students were engaged in hands-on activities, such as: dragon dance, jumping rabbit cards, Chinese calligraphy writing, playing percussion instruments, lantern drawing and making firecrackers. On top of that, students have a closer experience of Wushu and Guzheng performance during recess fringe activities.
