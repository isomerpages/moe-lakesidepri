It was an excellent platform for our students to hone their 21st Century Competencies and develop their appreciation for each other via teamwork. Through the various teambuilding and outdoor activities, students were given the opportunity to develop the school values of perseverance and respect. At the same time, they experienced the ruggedness and dynamism of being in the outdoors with nature.
