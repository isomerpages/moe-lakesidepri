What is the Future of Learning? To get some answers to that questions, our teachers took some time out on 27 May and 31 May to visit various organisations, as well as to walk the grounds of our surrounding areas. Gaining insights into our students’ living conditions and the future of work, we are better able to empathise with our students and have a better understanding of the Emerging 21st Century Competencies (E21CC) they will require in order to thrive in their future.
