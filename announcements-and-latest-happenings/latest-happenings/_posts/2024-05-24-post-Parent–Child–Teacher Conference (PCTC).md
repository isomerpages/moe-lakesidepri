During the Parent-Child-Teacher Conference (PCTC), students take the lead in showcasing their learning and school values, promoting self-directedness and ownership of their education. Parents gain insights into their child's progress during the sessions, held in classrooms. The process encourages reflective conversations between parents and children, enhancing positive learning dispositions. After the conference, parents write affirmations to boost their child's self-esteem and motivation, and children present thank you cards to their parents, reinforcing mutual appreciation and support.
