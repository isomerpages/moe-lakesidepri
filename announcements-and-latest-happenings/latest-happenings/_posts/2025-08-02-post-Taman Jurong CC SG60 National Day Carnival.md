<div style="font-size:14pt;" align="justify">In celebration of Singapore’s 60th National Day, our school proudly partnered with Taman Jurong Community Club to host an SG60 National Day Carnival that brought together students, staff and residents of the community in a joyous spirit of unity and pride.
<br><br>
The event was a meaningful platform for our students to showcase their empathetic leadership, communication and collaboration skills as they planned and facilitated a variety of engaging activities for the community. Through the interactive games, students worked closely with one another and with community partners to ensure that all visitors – from the young to the elderly – felt welcomed and included.
<br><br>
Through this carnival, our students demonstrated not only their creativity and teamwork but also their ability to serve with the heart. They listened attentively to the needs of the community, communicated ideas effectively and collaborated to bring the SG60 celebration to life.
<br><br>
The event was a beautiful reflection of what it means to be Singaporean – united, resilient, and always ready to uplift one another! </div>
