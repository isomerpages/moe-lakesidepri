Two groups from our Visual Arts Club participated, creating distinct artworks that connected everyday experiences with their aspirations for Singapore's future. The Category C group's masterpiece, titled ‘Small Sculptures, Grand Ideas’ earned a Certificate of Recognition and was selected for the onsite exhibition, demonstrating their exceptional creativity and artistic vision.</div><br>
