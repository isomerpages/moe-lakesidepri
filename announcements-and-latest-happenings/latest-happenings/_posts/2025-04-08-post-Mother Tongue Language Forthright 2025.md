<div style="font-size:14pt;" align="justify">MTL Fortnight and Primary 4 Cultural Camp were vibrant events filled with fun, friendship, and culture! Aligned with the theme “Strengthening Friendships Across Cultures in a Complex World,” students immersed themselves in traditional games, crafts, and activities that celebrated our diverse heritage. During recess, they teamed up with friends to complete exciting challenges, earn tokens, and learn about different cultures through play. In class, they explored the beauty of their Mother Tongue Languages while experiencing cultural traditions that promote respect and unity. Laughter echoed across the school as students bonded, collaborated, and embraced diversity. It was a joyful and meaningful fortnight experience for all!</div><br>
