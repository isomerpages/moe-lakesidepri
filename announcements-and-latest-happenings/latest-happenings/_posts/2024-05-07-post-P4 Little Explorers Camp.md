As part of our commitment to holistic development, we recently held a 3-day Little Explorers Camp for our Primary 4 students from 7 to 9 May. This camp, part of our Applied Learning and Outdoor Education Programme, aimed to develop responsible decision-making, creative problem-solving, respectful communication, and effective teamwork. Students engaged in activities such as camp craft, team-building games, orienteering, and creating an e-book using SCRATCH programming. This experience helped them step out of their comfort zones and grow in critical thinking, communication, and collaboration skills.
