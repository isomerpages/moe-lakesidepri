<div style="font-size:14pt;" align="justify">Primary 1 Orientation that took place on the 2 January 2026 was a special time where our youngest learners take their first steps into school life. Through fun, engaging classroom activities and gentle guidance, students get to know their teachers, classmates, and school routines in a warm and welcoming environment.
<br><br>
They learn how to infuse EFS into managing their belongings, follow classroom routines, and make new friends, all while building confidence and independence. Teachers support students closely to ensure they feel safe, happy, and excited to learn. This orientation period helps our Primary 1 students settle in comfortably and begin their learning journey with joy and confidence.</div>
