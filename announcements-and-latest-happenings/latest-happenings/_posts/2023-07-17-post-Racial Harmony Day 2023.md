The school commemorated Racial Harmony Day on 17 July, Monday. A series of exciting activities (e.g., assembly show, CCE (FTGP) lessons) was conducted for the students to deepen their understanding of racial harmony in Singapore. 
<br><br>
The Parent Support Group also organised activities for students to take part in to know more about traditional festivals such as Hari Raya, Pongal and Mid-autumn Festival. Through the activities, the students learnt to appreciate the different cultures that make up Singapore. <br>

Through the show, students learnt that racial harmony cannot be achieved if people are divided or segregated. By embracing diversity, they can create an environment of harmony and inclusivity in the society.
