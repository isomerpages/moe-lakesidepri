The school commemorated Racial Harmony Day on 17 July, Monday. A series of exciting activities (e.g., assembly show, CCE (FTGP) lessons) was conducted for the students to deepen their understanding of racial harmony in Singapore. 
<br><br>
The Parent Support Group also organised activities for students to take part in to know more about traditional festivals such as Hari Raya, Pongal and Mid-autumn Festival. Through the activities, the students learnt to appreciate the different cultures that make up Singapore. <br>
