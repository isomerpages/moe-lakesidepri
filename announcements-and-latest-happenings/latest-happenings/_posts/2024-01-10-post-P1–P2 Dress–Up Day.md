We extend heartfelt thanks to all the Primary One and Two students and staff who participated in our recent Dress-Up Day! It was a delightful day filled with creativity, laughter, and a burst of colorful characters. Seeing our young ones embodying their favorite personas and showcasing their unique styles according to the classroom theme was truly a joy. Looking forward to more exciting events and activities that foster creativity and camaraderie among our Primary One and Two students and staff!
