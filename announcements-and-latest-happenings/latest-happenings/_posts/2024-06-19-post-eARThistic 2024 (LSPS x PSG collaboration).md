This event is a collaboration between LSPS and our Parent Support Group (PSG). It is a celebration of community efforts towards a greener future. On 19 June, families came together for a picnic and did an art activity.<br>
The art activity aims at promoting sustainable practices in our daily lives. We hope that the event would ignite the spark in our little ones to make sustainability our way of life and create a brighter tomorrow together. Together, we will take charge and make a positive difference!
