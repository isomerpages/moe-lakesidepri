<div style="font-size:14pt;" align="justify">In commemoration of Total Defence Day, our school organised a range of activities, such as assembly programmes, recess activities and a simulated power disruption exercise. These activities were designed to create an engaging and meaningful learning experience, helping students deepen their understanding of the Total Defence message — that everyone has a role to play in standing together to protect Singapore and our shared way of life.</div>
