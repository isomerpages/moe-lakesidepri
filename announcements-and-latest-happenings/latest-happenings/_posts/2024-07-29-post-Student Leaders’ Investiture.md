On 29 July 2024, the school celebrated its Student Leaders’ Investiture to honoured our CCA Leaders, Peer Support Leaders and Prefects, recognising their leadership service with courage and commitment.<br>
The theme for this year's investiture echoes our school theme, "Take Charge and Make a Positive Difference." We celebrate not just the titles, but also the commitment they have shown to lead by example and inspire others. They continue to serve and make a positive difference in the school and beyond. 
Congratulations to all our newly appointed Student Leaders! To all our outgoing student leaders, thank you for your dedication and service!
