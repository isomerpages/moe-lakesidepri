This year’s Mother Tongue Language (MTL) Fortnight ride on the theme ‘Ignite Culture! Bring it to Life!’ which was unpacked from the school theme of ‘Taking Charge! Make a Positive Difference’. This reminds students to not only celebrate their culture but also take ownership of their identity and make a positive impact. A variety of activities were planned for the students to immerse in a cultural atmosphere. Students got to learn and take part in cross-cultural activities focusing on ethnic festivals which were planned during two recesses. The activities allowed students to not only learn about their own culture but also gain an appreciation for others'. Plus, participating in such activities encouraged students to foster empathy, understanding, and respect for cultural differences.
