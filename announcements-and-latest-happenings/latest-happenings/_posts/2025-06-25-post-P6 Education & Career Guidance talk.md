<div style="font-size:14pt;" align="justify">As part of our continued efforts to prepare students for the future, the school recently held an Education and Career Guidance (ECG) talk, organised in close collaboration with our Parent Support Group (PSG) and School Advisory Committee (SAC), for our Primary 6 students. ECG helps students develop a sense of purpose in life. By nurturing self-awareness and self-directedness for lifelong learning, ECG develops their growth mindset, adaptability and a resilient attitude to embrace future opportunities and appreciate the value of all occupations.<br><br>
Through this meaningful partnership, students had the invaluable opportunity to hear directly from professionals across a range of industries. The diverse speakers shared real-world insights into their careers, workplace experiences, and the skills needed in today’s evolving job landscape.<br><br>
The session sparked curiosity, broadened perspectives, and encouraged students to think deeply about their aspirations and the paths they can pursue. In all, they gained a better understanding of the working world and felt more motivated to explore their strengths and interests.</div><br>
